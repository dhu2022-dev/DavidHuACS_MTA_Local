{"text": "Abstract A core-shell approach that utilizes a high-surface-area conducting core and an outer semiconductor shell is exploited here to prepare p-type dye-sensitized solar energy cells that operate with a minimal applied bias. Photocathodes were prepared by coating thin films of nanocrystalline indium tin oxide with a 0.8 nm Al2O3 seeding layer, followed by the chemical growth of non-stoichiometric strontium titanate. Films were annealed and sensitized with either a porphyrin chromophore or a chromophore-catalyst molecular assembly consisting of the porphyrin covalently tethered to the ruthenium complex. The sensitized photoelectrodes produced cathodic photocurrents of up to -315 \u03bcA/cm2 under simulated sunlight (AM1.5G, 100 mW/cm2) in aqueous media, pH 5. The photocurrent was increased by the addition of regenerative hole-donors to the system, consistent with slow interfacial recombination kinetics, an important property of p-type dye-sensitized electrodes.\n###\n", "label": [[9, 970, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT: Monitoring externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) and gaining insights into molecular events of cell membrane damage are significant for programmed cell death studies. Herein, by encapsulating zeolitic imidazole frameworks-8 (ZIF-8) with plasmonic gold nanoparticles to form micron-nano composites and used as single particle SERS substrate, we succeeded in real-time discriminating and monitoring the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on cell membrane during electrostimulus-induced apoptosis. The micron-nano composite probe provides rich \u201chot spots\u201d and robust anchoring capacity for cell membrane, achieving the capture and label-free single-particle surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection of the externalized phosphatidylserine. By the method, the dynamic PS externalization process difference between cancerous cells and normal cells were clearly revealed, of which the cell membrane damage of cancerous cells was more serious than normal cells. The method is versatile and robust for monitoring the externalization of PS and uncovering related cell membrane damage mechanisms.

{"text": "Influence of microgel fabrication technique on granular hydrogel properties\n###\n", "label": [[0, 75, "title"]]}
{"text": "Abstract  Bulk hydrogels traditionally used for tissue engineering and drug delivery have numerous limitations, such as restricted injectability and a nanoscale porosity that reduces cell invasion and mass transport. An evolving approach to address these limitations is the fabrication of hydrogel microparticles (i.e., \u201cmicrogels\u201d) that can be assembled into granular hydrogels. There are numerous methods to fabricate microgels; however, the influence of the fabrication technique on granular hydrogel properties is unexplored. Herein, we investigated the influence of three microgel fabrication techniques (microfluidic devices [MD], batch emulsions [BE], mechanical fragmentation by extrusion [EF]) on resulting granular hydrogel properties (e.g., mechanics, porosity, injectability). Hyaluronic acid (HA) modified with various reactive groups (i.e., norbornenes [NorHA], pentenoates [HA-PA], methacrylates [MeHA]) were used to form microgels with an average diameter of ~100 \u03bcm. The MD method resulted in homogenous spherical microgels, the BE method resulted in heterogenous spherical microgels, and the EF method resulted in heterogenous polygonal microgels. Across the various reactive groups, microgels fabricated with the MD and BE methods had lower functional group consumption when compared to microgels fabricated with the EF method. When microgels were jammed into granular hydrogels, the storage modulus (G\u2019) of EF granular hydrogels (~1,000 \u2013 3,000 Pa) was consistently an order of magnitude higher than that of MD and BE granular hydrogels (~50 \u2013 200 Pa). Void space was comparable across all groups, although EF granular hydrogels exhibited an increased number of pores and decreased average pore size when compared to MD and BE granular hydrogels. Furthermore, granular hydrogel properties were tuned by varying the amount of crosslinker used during microgel fabrication. Lastly, granular hydrogels were injectable across formulations due to their general shear-thinning and self-healing properties. Taken together, this work thoroughly characterizes the influence of microgel fabrication technique on granular hydrogel properties to inform the design of future systems for biomedical applications. \n###\n", "label": [[10, 2217, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "Abstract The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a newly emerged strain that has never been found in humans before. At present, the laboratory-based reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the main method to confirm COVID-19 infection. The intensification of the COVID-19 epidemic overwhelms limited clinical resources in particular, but not only, in developing countries, resulting in many patients not being tested for the infection and in large queues of potentially infected individuals waiting to be tested while providing a breeding ground for the disease. We describe here a rapid, highly sensitive, point-of-care, molecular test amenable for use at home, in the clinic, and at points of entry by minimally trained individuals and with minimal instrumentation. Our test is based on loop mediated isothermal amplification (COVID-19 LAMP) and for higher sensitivity on nested nucleic acid, two stage isothermal amplification (COVID-19 Penn-RAMP). Both tests can be carried out in closed tubes with either fluorescence or colorimetric (e.g., leuco crystal violet LCV) detection. COVID-19 LAMP performs on par with COVID-19 RT-PCR. COVID-19 RAMP has 10 fold better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMP and COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing purified targets and 100 times better sensitivity than COVID-19 LAMP and COVID-19 RT-PCR when testing rapidly prepared sample mimics. Due to fortunate scarcity of COVID-19 infections in the USA, we were not able to test our assays and methods with patient samples. We hope that such tests will be carried out by colleagues in impacted countries. Our Closed-Tube Penn-RAMP has the potential to significantly reduce false negatives while being amenable to use with minimal instrumentation and training.\n###\n", "label": [[9, 1753, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "Synthetic Oligosaccharide-based Vaccines Protect Mice from Clostridium difficile Infections\n###\n", "label": [[0, 91, "title"]]}
{"text": "ABSTRACT: Infections with Clostridium difficile (also known as Clostridioides difficile) have risen in incidence, morbidity and mortality over the past decade. Preventing infections is becoming increasingly important, as frontline antibiotics become less effective and frequently induce recurrence by disrupting intestinal microbiota. The clinically most advanced vaccine approaches prevent symptoms once C. difficile infection is established by inducing immunity to secreted clostridial cytotoxins. However, they do not inhibit bacterial colonization and thereby favor asymptomatic carriage. Synthetic oligosaccharides (OS) resembling the C. difficile surface glycans PS-I, PS-II, and PS-III are immunogenic and serve as basis for colonization-preventing vaccines. Here, we demonstrate that glycoconjugate vaccine candidates based on synthetic OS protected mice from infections with two different C. difficile strains. Four synthetic antigens, ranging in size from di- to hexasaccharides, were conjugated to CRM197, a carrier protein used in commercial vaccines. The vaccine candidates induced glycan-specific antibodies in mice and substantially limited C. difficile colonization and colitis after experimental infection. The glycoconjugates ameliorated intestinal pathology more substantially than a toxin-targeting vaccine. Colonization of the gut by C. difficile was selectively inhibited while intestinal microbiota remained preserved. Serum transfer experiments revealed that protection is mediated by specific anti-glycan antibodies. Thus, glycoconjugate vaccines against C. difficile are a complementary approach to toxin-targeting strategies and are advancing through preclinical work.\n###\n", "label": [[10, 1695, "abstract"]]}

The process is spontaneous, and requires neither intelligence nor moral purpose, but is nevertheless difficult to understand. The late Dan Tawfik spent years studying enzymes as they adapted to recognize new substrates. Much of his work focused on gaining fundamental insights, so the practical utility of his experiments may not be obvious even to accomplished protein engineers. Here we focus on two questions fundamental to any directed evolution experiment. Which proteins are the best starting points for such experiments? Which trait(s) of the chosen parental protein should be evolved to achieve the desired outcome? Here we summarize Tawfik\u2019s contributions to our understanding of these problems, to honor his memory and encourage those unfamiliar with his ideas to read his publications.\n###\n", "label": [[10, 885, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT: Carboxylic acids, including amino acids (AAs), have been widely used as reagents for decarboxylative couplings. In contrast to previous decarboxylative couplings that release CO2 as a waste byproduct, herein we report a novel strategy with simultaneous utilization of both the alkyl and carboxyl components from carboxylic acids. Under this unique strategy, carboxylic acids act as bifunctional reagents in the redox-neutral carbo-carboxylation of alkenes. Diverse inexpensive and readily available \u03b1-AAs take part in such difunctionalizations of activated alkenes via visible-light photoredox catalysis, affording a variety of valuable but otherwise difficult-to-access \u03b3-aminobutyric acid derivatives (GABAs). Additionally, a series of dipeptides and tripeptide also participate in this photocatalytic carbo-carboxylation. Although several challenges exist in this system due to the low concentration and quantitative amount of CO2, as well as unproductive side reactions such as hydrodecarboxylation of the carboxylic acids and hydroalkylation of the alkenes, excellent regioselectivity and moderate-to-high chemoselectivity are achieved. This process features low catalyst loading, mild reaction conditions, high step- and atom-economy, good functional group tolerance, and it is readily scalable. The resulting products are subject to efficient derivations and the overall process is amenable for applications in late-stage modification of complex compounds. Mechanistic studies indicate that a carbanion is generated catalytically and it acts as the key intermediate to react with CO2, which is also generated catalytically in situ and thus remains in low concentration. The overall transformation represents an efficient and sustainable system for organic synthesis, pharmaceutics and biochemistry. \n###\n", "label": [[10, 1815, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "Abstract 0216 Purpose- The purpose of this paper is to analyse dynamic drape behaviours of 100% wool woven suiting fabrics considering real-time usage.  Design/methodology/approach- Dynamic drape coefficients of 100% wool woven fabrics were measured at different rotation speeds (25 rpm, 75 rpm, 125 rpm, and 175 rpm) with a commercially used fabric drape tester which works on image processing principle. Average daily walking speed of male and female volunteers were determined and the closest rotation speed was selected to calculate Dynamic Drape Coefficient at Walking (DDCw). Besides, bending rigidity and shear deformation properties, which are known to be related to the static drape behaviours of the fabrics, were also measured and the relationships between these parameters and DDCw were examined. Findings- As a result of the experimental study, it was found that dynamic drape coefficients become greater, which means the fabrics take flatter position, with the increase of the rotation speed. In addition, it was also seen that parameters known to be related to static drape behaviours such as unit weight and bending stiffness have less effect on the dynamic drapes of fabrics. For the estimation of dynamic drape behaviour of fabrics, parameters such as static perimeter, dynamic perimeter etc. are found more significant. Originality/value- To date, although studies about dynamic drape behaviours of the fabrics are claimed that dynamic drape gives more realistic results for in wearer experience, few of them focused on the rotation speed of dynamic drape tester for real-time usage. As dynamic drape behaviours of fabrics may differ for different rotation speed, determining appropriate speed in accordance with real time usage give more realistic results.

{"text": "Abstract Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a major pollutant in indoor air. The development of low-cost and high-efficiency technologies to remove HCHO at room temperature is thus of great importance. Here, we developed a simple method involving acid pretreatment of SiO2 to improve a Pd/SiO2(HNO3)-R catalyst for HCHO oxidation. Multiple characterization results illustrated that hydroxyl groups on SiO2 produced by the acid pretreatment favored the anchoring of Pd particles and increased their dispersion. The increase in Pd dispersion induced more oxygen vacancies on the surface of Pd/SiO2(HNO3)-R catalysts because of the increased number of hydrogen spillover sites; this further enhanced H2O activation to form surface-active hydroxyl groups, thus significantly increasing the intrinsic activity of the Pd/SiO2(HNO3)-R catalyst for HCHO oxidation.Keywords: Formaldehyde, Acid treatment, Hydroxyl groups, Oxygen vacancies\n###\n", "label": [[9, 844, "abstract"], [9, 21, "keyword"], [868, 882, "keyword"], [884, 899, "keyword"], [901, 917, "keyword"]]}

{"text": "Abstract The term \u201cspodium bond\u201d (SpB) has been recently proposed to describe the non-coordinative interaction that can be established between a polarized group 12 metal and a mild Lewis base. Most of the systems showing short metal-donor distances compatible with SpB are characterized by the coexistence of multiple weak interactions, including hydrogen and halogen bonding, making the assessment of real importance of SpB difficult. Here we show that the relative importance of each contribution can be probed by dissecting the orbital component of the interaction through the Natural Orbital for Chemical Valence-Charge Displacement analysis (NOCV-CD). NOCV-CD gives straightforward snapshots of relative energies and electrons involved, either for model and \u201creal\u201d adducts, allowing us to demonstrate the lack of a direct correlation between a favorable metal-base distance and the presence of an orbital contribution for the SpB.\n###\n", "label": [[9, 935, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT   Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), butyl carbitol, and corrosion inhibitors are components of aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs). Volatile (neutral) fluorotelomerization (FT)- and electrochemical fluorination (ECF)-based PFAS, butyl carbitol, and three organic corrosion inhibitors were quantified in 39 Military Specification (MilSpec), non-MilSpec, and alcohol resistant-AFFF concentrates (undiluted formulations) dating from 1974-2010. Fluorotelomer alcohols were found only in FT-based AFFFs and N-methyl- and N-ethyl-perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides and sulfonamido ethanols were found only in ECF-based AFFFs. Neutral PFAS and benzotriazole, 4-methylbenzotriazole, and 5-methybenzotriazole, occurred at mg/L levels in the AFFFs, while butyl carbitol occurred at g/L levels. Neutral PFAS concentrations in indoor air due to vapor intrusion are estimated to be anywhere from two to more than ten orders of magnitude higher than documented background indoor air concentrations. Estimated butyl carbitol and organic corrosion inhibitor concentrations were lower than and comparable to indoor concentrations recently measured, respectively. The wide range of neutral PFAS concentrations and Henry\u2019s law constants indicate field, soil-gas measurements are needed to validate the estimations. Co-discharged butyl carbitol likely contributes to oxygen depletion in AFFF-impacted aquifers and may hinder the natural aerobic biotransformation of PFAS. Organic corrosion inhibitors in AFFFs indicate these are another source of corrosion inhibitors in the environment.\n###\n", "label": [[11, 1578, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT Since their discovery, Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) have been explored in multiple applications. However, the complete physico-chemical characterization is still non-existent for many of the proposed and used DES. In particular, vapor pressure, which is a crucial property for the application of DES as solvents, is very rarely available. In this work, the measurement of the total and partial pressures of two sulfolane-based DES, tetrabutylammonium bromide:sulfolane and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide:sulfolane, in several proportions, from 40\u00baC to 100\u00baC and atmospheric pressure, was performed using head-space gas chromatography mass spectrometry, HS-GC-MS. A large decrease on the total pressure was recorded which, together with the finding that total pressures showed negative deviations from Raoult\u00b4s Law, is indicative of the favourable, strong interactions between the two components within the DES. Additionally, the study of vapor pressure change with DES molar composition was carried out and, surprisingly, the existence of inflection points in the pressure curve was observed. Experimental results were modelled using PC-SAFT equation of state and, in addition, MD simulations were performed to provide a molecular understanding of the pressure data. Considering the different results and insights obtained from the used strategies, it can be concluded that the both DES systems have especially strong interactions between salt and sulfolane, at high sulfolane content, due to the different structural rearrangement of the liquid state.\n###\n", "label": [[9, 1560, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "Abstract Introduction  This study aimed to examine the trends in adherence to the Physical Activity Guidelines (PAG) for aerobic activity and sedentary time and their effects on mortality and disease progression among US adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD).  Methods  We studied individuals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-08 to 2017-18 with a mortality file in 2015. Multivariate regression models were used to evaluate the association between adherence to PAG and sedentary time with mortality, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Results   For the CKD population, adherence rate increased from 48.2% in 2007-08 to 55.0% in 2017-18, and sedentary time peaked in 2013-14 (7.5 hours/day) and then decreased afterward. There was no difference in the trends across the non-CKD and CKD population. For the CKD population, adherence to the PAG was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.63), malignant neoplasm mortality (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.52), and albumin-creatinine-ratio (OR, -0.27; 95% CI: -0.39 to -0.15). Sedentary time was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.15), heart disease mortality (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.19), and eGFR (OR, -0.49; 95% CI, -0.72 to -0.26).  Conclusions  Favorable trends were observed in adherence to the PAG and sedentary time. Adherence to the PAG and reduction in sedentary time reduced all-cause and cause-specific mortality and prevented disease progression differently. Efforts are needed to decrease sedentary time rather than adhering to the PAG for aerobic activity alone.\n###\n", "label": []}

Similar results were observed in the sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Table 2 in the Supplemental Material).   Discussion  According to the most recent report, more than 1 in 7, that is 15% of US adults or 37 million people, are estimated to have CKD[7]. Although a majority of nephrologists are of the opinion that their CKD patients should exercise regularly to improve health[24], rates of physical activity and exercise counseling remain low[25, 26]. In addition, adherence to the PAG was rather low[27]. In this nationally representative study, we investigated the trends in adherence to the PAG for aerobic activity and sedentary time in US adults with CKD, which have not been reported before. The current study offers welcome findings. The proportion of individuals with CKD adhering to the PAG for aerobic activity increased significantly from 2007-08 to 2017-18. While the sedentary time for the individuals with CKD increased from 2007-08 to 2013-2014, it decreased for 2 consecutive survey cycles after 2013-14. These trends were consistent across CKD and non-CKD populations and across different subgroups of the CKD population. The reason for these favorable trends remains further investigation, especially under the fact that the rate of awareness of the PAG is still low now[28].   According to the previous findings, the sedentary time was also highest in 2013-14 among the general population and then decreased during the following years[5, 29]. While the reasons for this remain unclear, we believe that the great efforts by the US government as well as by the public play an important role. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched several surveillance systems, including National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), to estimate and track the prevalence of physical activity for adults in the US. These systems are used to track progress on many different national health objectives, including the physical activity objective in Health People 2010 and Health People 2020[30]. As the leading health indicator for the Healthy People objectives, physical activity is monitored continuously and used to inform policy decisions related to physical activity. Moreover, due to the increasing amount of attention as a public health problem, the second edition of PAG started to address the health effects of sedentary behavior which was not addressed in the first edition[3]. Thus, these efforts would lead, at least in part, to the reduction of sedentary behavior among the US population.   CKD is associated with physical inactivity. In patients with CKD not requiring renal replacement therapy, physical activity worsens with GFR lowering and is associated with frailty and disability[31]. Individuals with CKD have significantly reduced peak oxygen consumption, self-reported physical functioning, and physical performance compared to those with normal kidney function, which might be caused by several factors, including renal anemia, malnutrition, uremic toxins, vitamin D deficiency, and abnormal potassium metabolism[32, 33]. Nonetheless, the functional limitation in the CKD population could be improved with increased physical activity. In a meta-analysis with 31 randomized controlled trials that studied aerobic exercise in adults with CKD, the author found a significant improvement in peak oxygen consumption, exercise duration, physical role, and general health after aerobic training[14]. Thus, physical function in the CKD population could be improved by physical activity.   Research regarding the beneficial effects of physical activity on mortality and disease progression in individuals with CKD is limited by its consistency and nature of study design[9]. The current study investigated the impact of adherence to the PAG for aerobic activity on mortality among individuals with CKD. In this prospective cohort, we found that adherence to the PAG decreased the all-cause and malignant neoplasm mortality after adjusting for all potential covariates. A recent study based on National Health Interview Survey found that the recommended physical activity greatly reduced the risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality[34]. However, this study targeted the general population and included only leisure time aerobic activity. Another study investigated the recommended physical activity and mortality in individuals with CKD based on data from NHANES III, and the results indicated that physical activity was associated with decreased mortality[18]. However, this study also included only leisure time activity and the evaluation of adherence to physical activity was based on a different recommendation[35].   Consistent with previous findings suggesting that prolonged sedentary time is associated with poor health and functional capacity[36], the current study also indicated that prolonged sedentary time increased the risk of all-cause and heart disease mortality in the CKD population. Even though highly related, sedentary behavior has proved not to be just the opposite part of physical activity[37]. Evidence shows that high levels of moderate intensity aerobic activity are needed to eliminate the increased risk of death induced by prolonged sedentary time. Thus, advanced efforts should be made to reduce the total sedentary time and then increase physical activity.   We found that the CKD population had a greater reduction in their all-cause and malignant neoplasm mortality when adhering to the PAG for aerobic activity than the non-CKD population. Similarly, a greater increase in the all-cause and heart disease mortality was observed along with prolonged sedentary behavior in the CKD population than in the non-CKD population. Therefore, these results indicated that adhering to the PAG for the aerobic activity or reducing sedentary time could provide more survival benefits in the CKD population than in the non-CKD population. To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides such a finding and it suggests that increasing activity and reducing sitting time might be more important for the CKD population than for the non-CKD population.   The current study indicated that physical activity and sedentary behavior had a different impact on the cause-specific mortality and disease progression among the CKD population. Adherence to PAG for aerobic activity decreased the risk of malignant neoplasm mortality, but not heart disease mortality. It also decreased the level of urine albumin-creatinine-ratio while having no significant effect on the level of eGFR. This result was consistent with the previous 2 meta-analyses[12, 38]. Conversely, prolonged sedentary time increased the risk of heart disease mortality, but not malignant neoplasm mortality. It also decreased the level of eGFR while having no significant effect on the level of urine albumin-creatinine-ratio. This evidence highlights the importance of reducing sedentary time among the CKD population rather than being physically active alone.  \n###\n", "label": []}

{"text": "ABSTRACT: To figure out the reason for the drawback of the SWIFT waveform and realize the high-resolution ion isolation on the miniaturized linear ion trap mass spectrometer, we studied the efficiency that ions can be excited under different excitation durations and amplitudes at different frequencies and compared the overlap ratios of the effective excitation frequency bandwidths of the adjacent ions. According to this, we proposed a new coarse-to-fine isolation waveform named SWIFTSIN. By superposing one or more sinusoidal waveforms on the SWIFT waveform and modulating the phases of the superposed sinusoidal waveforms, the generated SWIFTSIN waveform can achieve unit mass isolation on the miniaturized linear ion trap mass spectrometer without reducing the intensity of the target ion. The isolation ability of the SWIFTSIN waveform was verified by isolating a single isotope peak in the mixed samples. 22 With high sensitivity and specificity, mass spectrometry has been widely used and playing an increasingly important role in biological research, food and drug analysis, explosive detection, etc.1-4 Compared with the large-scale instruments used in the laboratory, the miniaturized ion\n###\n", "label": [[10, 913, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "Abstract  Alcohol abuse is harmful to human health, and many strategies have been developed to retard this harm through protecting liver or activating relative enzymes. In this study, a new strategy of decreasing the alcohol absorption directly depending on the dealcoholization by the bacteria in the upper gastrointestinal tract was reported. To realize this, a bacteria-loaded gastro-retention oral delivery system with pore structure was constructed through emulsification/internal gelation, which could relieve acute alcohol intoxication in mice successfully.  It was found that this bacteria-loaded system kept the above 30% suspension ratio in the simulated gastric fluid for 4 min, displayed good protection effect for the bacteria, and decreased the alcohol concentration from 50% to 30% below within 24 h in vitro. The in vivo imaging results demonstrated that it remained in the upper gastrointestinal tract until 24 h and reduce 41.9% alcohol absorption. The mice with oral administration of the bacteria-loaded system were found with normal gait, smooth coat and less liver damage. Although the intestinal flora distribution was influenced slightly during the oral administration, it could restore to normal levels only one day after stopping oral administration quickly, suggesting good biosafety. In conclusion, these results revealed that the bacteria-loaded gastro-retention oral delivery system might intake alcohol molecules rapidly and has huge potential in the treatment of alcohol abuse.\n###\n", "label": [[10, 1509, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "Abstract  Ultrathin metal-fluoride barrier coatings on the surface of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cathodes can improve cycling stability and prevent corrosion by acidic byproducts in the electrolyte. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an effective method to deposit ultrathin metal fluoride coatings on LIB cathodes. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the benefit of ALD metal fluoride coatings to LIB performance, comparatively few works have examined the effect of individual ALD precursors on the cathode surface. This paper uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements to elucidate the surface chemical changes on LIB cathode material surfaces upon exposure to the ALD metal fluoride precursor, hydrogen fluorine pyridine (HFPy). We found a decrease in surface carbonate and an increase in surface fluoride after HFPy exposure suggesting the conversion of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) to lithium fluoride (LiF). This conversion is desirable given that Li2CO3 degrades LIB performance whereas LiF provides an excellent physio-chemical barrier against chemical attack during cycling. Scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy, and XPS measurements following HFPy exposure to Li2CO3 powder revealed the formation of a conformal LiF shell around the Li2CO3 particles. Finally, we confirmed the complete conversion of ~7 nm ALD Li2CO3 films on silicon from HFPy exposure using XPS and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The elimination of problematic Li2CO3 from LIB cathode surfaces and conversion into a protective LiF coating via a single precursor vapor treatment may provide a cost-effective method for enhancing LIB performance.\n###\n", "label": [[10, 1679, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT. Determining the secondary and tertiary structures of proteins at aqueous interfaces is crucial for understanding their function but measuring these structures selectively at the interface is challenging. Here we demonstrate that two dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy of protein stabilized emulsions offers a new route to measuring interfacial protein structure with high levels of detail. We prepared hexadecane/water oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by model LK peptides that are known to fold into either \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-sheet conformations at hydrophobic interfaces, and measured 2D-IR spectra in a transmission geometry. We saw clear spectral signatures of the peptides folding at the interface, with no detectable residue from remaining bulk peptides. Using 2D spectroscopy gives us access to correlation and dynamics data, which enables structural assignment in cases where linear spectroscopy fails. Using the emulsions allows one to study interfacial spectra with standard transmission geometry spectrometers, bringing the richness of 2D-IR to the interface with no additional optical complexity.

{"text": "KEYWORDS LK peptide, surface protein, oil-water interface, secondary structure Many solvated proteins radically change their conformations at aqueous interfaces, thanks to the interplay of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues with surfaces.11 As much of chemistry and biology occurs at these interfaces, understanding protein structure at them is vital.2-4 One of the most powerful techniques for measuring secondary and tertiary structure of proteins is two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy, a third-order nonlinear spectroscopy that reveals spectral correlations and allow dynamics to be tracked with femtosecond resolution.5-11 However, like linear IR spectroscopy, 2D-IR is not a surface specific technique and so the samples or experimental geometry must be very carefully designed in order to minimize bulk contributions.1212 Typically this involves immobilizing a monolayer of analyte to a solid substrate, which prevents measurements at liquid/liquid or liquid/gas interfaces, although reflection 2D-IR of an organometallic surfactant monolayer at the air/water interface has also been demonstrated.1313 A closely related technique is vibrational 2D sum frequency generation (2D-SFG) spectroscopy, which is a fourth order nonlinear spectroscopy that produces similar 2D vibrational spectra, but thanks to selection rules is selectively sensitive only to molecules at interfaces, so the requirement to create an immobile monolayer is relaxed.14-16 2D-SFG has been used to study proteins and peptides at solid/gas interfaces,17-19 and long-chain alcohol monolayers at liquid/gas interfaces,20, 21 however low signal levels and complex geometries make it a much more challenging experiment to perform than transmission 2D-IR, which is well established by now.\n###\n", "label": [[9, 19, "keyword"], [21, 36, "keyword"], [38, 57, "keyword"], [59, 78, "keyword"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT: The dysregulation of dopamine, a neuromodulator, is associated with a broad spectrum of brain disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s disease, addiction, and schizophrenia. Quantitative measurements of dopamine are essential for understanding dopamine functional dynamics. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is the most widely used electrochemical technique for measuring real-time in vivo dopamine level changes. Standard FSCV has only been used to analyze \u201cphasic dopamine\u201d (changes in seconds), because the gradual generation of background charging current is inevitable, and acts as the main noise source in the low-frequency band. Although \u201ctonic dopamine\u201d (changes in minutes to hours) is key for understanding the dopamine system, an electrochemical technique capable of simultaneously measuring phasic and tonic dopamine in an in vivo environment has not been established. Several modified voltammetric techniques have been developed for measuring tonic dopamine, but the sampling rates (0.1-0.05 Hz) are too low to be useful. Further investigation of the in vivo applicability of previously developed background drift removal methods for measuring tonic dopamine levels is required. We developed a second-derivative-based background removal (SDBR) method for simultaneously measuring phasic and tonic neurotransmitter levels in real-time. The performance of this technique was tested via in silico and in vitro tonic dopamine experiments. Furthermore, its applicability was tested in vivo. SDBR is a simple, robust, post-processing technique that can extract tonic neurotransmitter levels from all FSCV data. As SDBR is calculated in individual-scan voltammogram units, it can be applied to any real-time closed-loop system that uses a neurotransmitter as a biomarker.   Dopamine is a neuromodulator that conveys important information such as cognition, reward and pleasure, and voluntary motor movements.1, 2 Dysregulation of the dopamine system is associated with a broad spectrum of brain disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, addiction, and schizophrenia.1, 3, 4 Dopamine levels in the target areas of the brain display highly dynamic changes, with fluctuations on different timescales. These changes include rapid transients, which are ramps that may last for several seconds (phasic), and oscillations on the timescale of minutes to hours (tonic).22 Quantitative analysis of dopamine levels is crucial for learning about the functional role of dopamine dynamics in the normal brain, as well as studying brain-disorder pathology in pre-clinical and clinical studies.   Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with a carbon fiber microelectrode (CFM) is a well-established electrochemical technique that can effectively measure dopamine-level changes in the brain.55 FSCV measures faradaic current changes based on the dopamine oxidation peak voltage exhibited in a voltammogram, after subtracting the background current.66 The high scan rate of FSCV is sensitive enough to measure rapid changes in dopamine levels (phasic dopamine), but it also generates a progressively large background charging current (capacitive current), making it difficult to analyze voltammetry beyond 2 min.7, 8 The steady rise in the amplitude of the dopamine peak in FSCV due to this background charging current is called background drift. FSCV background drift makes it difficult to measure slow changes in dopamine levels (tonic dopamine).  Attempts to measure tonic dopamine levels in the brain in real-time are still challenging. Modified voltammetric techniques have been proposed for measuring tonic dopamine in vivo.9-12 These modified voltammetric techniques measure tonic dopamine levels, but the low temporal resolution (10\u201320 s) makes it difficult to analyze detailed dopamine signaling for understanding neuropsychiatric disorders. The high-pass filtering technique can measure phasic dopamine with background drift removed, but also removes tonic dopamine levels, which have a similar frequency band to that of the background drift.1313 Recently, tonic dopamine measurement using background drift removal was attempted using modified FSCV.14, 15 These methods attempted to estimate the background with an additional voltage waveform; however, estimating the background of the in vivo system with an electrode-specific training set still needs further investigation. An integration-based method estimates tonic dopamine by integrating around the dopamine peak of the background-subtracted voltammogram.1616 In this integration-based method, the user must set the integration potential range, causing potential bias in the estimated dopamine level, which can lead to inadequate estimates of tonic dopamine levels.  In this study, we developed a second-derivative-based background drift removal (SDBR) method for measuring phasic and tonic dopamine levels using standard FSCV. SDBR extracts tonic dopamine information by applying a second derivative from the dopamine oxidation peaks in the background-subtracted voltammogram. SDBR uses voltammetry measured with standard FSCV waveforms, so it provides additional tonic dopamine information to all FSCV studies that measure phasic dopamine. Since the second derivative is applied to individual voltammograms generated every 0.1 second, it can be applied to real-time systems. \n###\n", "label": [[10, 1781, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT: One of the major challenges in developing direct hydrazine fuel cells (DHzFCs) is the creation of highly efficient, robust, and inexpensive electrocatalysts with superaerophobic property for hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Herein, a cobalt phosphide nanowires array (CoP-NWA@CP) is grown on a carbon paper substrate as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for HzOR in alkaline medium, which features a superaerophobic surface that is highly anti-gaseous and conducive to nitrogen evolution (a gaseous byproduct of HzOR). The catalyst demonstrates significant HzOR performance with an onset potential of -97 mV (vs RHE), an ultralow overpotential of 82 mV@100 mA cm-2, and superior stability with little current density loss over 10,000 s at an overpotential of 0.42 V (vs RHE). The remarkable HzOR performance of the CoP-NWA@CP catalyst is attributed not only to its high intrinsic activity but also to its nanowire array design, which offers a large specific surface area, rapid electron and mass transfer, and superaerophobic surface wettability to expedite the release of N2 from the catalyst surface. Furthermore, a DHzFC is constructed using the CoP-NWA@CP catalyst as the anode and commercial MnO2 as the cathode, which delivers a high open-circult voltage of 0.905 V, a remarkable power density of 300 mW cm-2, and a power density retention of 95% after running for 12.5 h, indicating great potential candidature of CoP-NWA@CP for practical applications.\n###\n", "label": [[10, 1474, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "  Abstract  Tetrameric hemoglobins (Hbs) are prototypal systems for studies aimed at unveiling basic structure-function relationships as well as to investigate the molecular/structural basis of living organisms adaptation to extreme conditions. However, a chronological analysis of decade-long studies conducted on Hbs is illuminating on the difficulties associated with the attempts of gaining functional insights from static structures. Here, we applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the functional transition from the T to the R state of the hemoglobin of the Antarctic fish Trematomus bernacchii (HbTb). Our study clearly demonstrates the ability of the MD technique to accurately describe the transition of HbTb from the T to R-like states as shown by a number of global and local structural indicators. A comparative analysis of the structural states that HbTb assumes in the simulations with those detected in previous MD analyses conducted on HbA (human Hb) highlights interesting analogies (similarity of the transition pathway) and differences (distinct population of intermediate states). In particular, the ability of HbTb to significantly populate intermediate states along the functional pathway explains the observed propensity of this protein to assume these structures in the crystalline state. It also explains some functional data reported on the protein that indicate the occurrence of other functional states in addition to the canonical R and T ones. These findings are in line with the emerging idea that the classical two-state view underlying tetrameric Hb functionality is probably an over-simplification and that other structural states play important roles in these proteins. The ability of MD simulations to accurately describe the functional pathway in tetrameric Hbs suggests that this approach may be effectively applied to unravel the molecular and structural basis of Hbs exhibiting peculiar functional properties as a consequence of the environmental adaptation of the host organism. \n###\n", "label": [[12, 2035, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "Abstract: Fully aromatic polyimides are amenable to efficient carbonization in thin two-dimensional (2D) films due to a complement of aromaticity and planarity of backbone repeating units. However, repeating unit rigidity traditionally imposes processing limitations, restricting many fully-aromatic polyimides, i.e., pyromellitic dianhydride with 4,4\u2019-oxydianiline (PMDA-ODA) polyimides, to a 2D form factor. Recently, research efforts in our laboratories enabled additive manufacturing of micron-scale resolution PMDA-ODA polyimide objects using vat photopolymerization (VP) and Ultraviolet-assisted direct ink write (UV-DIW) following careful thermal post-processing of the three-dimensional (3D) organogel precursors to 400 \u00b0C. Further thermal post-processing of printed objects to 1000 \u00b0C induced pyrolysis of the PMDA-ODA objects to disordered carbon. The pyrolyzed objects retained excellent geometric resolution, and Raman spectroscopy displayed characteristic disordered (D) and graphitic (G) carbon bands. Scanning electron microscopy probed the cross-sectional homogeneity of the carbonized samples, revealing an absence of pore formation during carbonization. Likewise, impedance analysis of carbonized specimens indicated only a moderate decrease in conductivity compared to thin films that were pyrolyzed using an identical carbonization process. Facile pyrolysis of PMDA-ODA objects now enables production of carbonaceous monoliths with complex and predictable three-dimensional geometries using commercially available starting materials. \n###\n", "label": [[10, 1553, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT  Net-zero carbon strategies and green synthesis methodologies are key to realizing United Nations\u2019 sustainable development goals (SDGs) on a global scale. Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) holds the promise of upcycling excess glycerol from biodiesel production directly into precious hydrocarbon commodities that worth orders of magnitude more than the glycerol feedstock. Despite years of research on GOR, the synthesis process of nanoscale electrocatalysts still involves (1) prohibitive heat input, (2) expensive vacuum chambers, and (3) emission of toxic liquid pollutants. In this manuscript, these knowledge gaps are closed via developing a laser-assisted nanomaterial preparation (LANP) process to fabricate binder-free bimetallic nanocatalysts (1) at room temperature, (2) under ambient atmosphere, and (3) without liquid waste emission. Specifically, PdCu nanoparticles with adjustable Pd:Cu content supported on few-layer graphene directly printed on an electrode can be prepared using this one-step LANP method with performance that can rival state-of-the-art GOR catalysts. Beyond exhibiting high GOR activity, the LANP-fabricated PdCu/C nanomaterials with optimized Pd:Cu ratio further deliver exclusive product selectivity up to 99% for partially oxidized C3 products with value over 280,000 folds of glycerol. This dry LANP method is envisioned to afford scalable production of multi-metallic nanomaterials on integrated electrodes in a sustainable fashion as efficient electrocatalytic systems for other redox reactions with intricate proton-coupled electron transfer steps that are central to the widespread deployment of renewable energy schemes and carbon neutral technologies. \n###\n", "label": [[10, 1723, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT: One of the major challenges in developing direct hydrazine fuel cells (DHzFCs) is the creation of highly efficient, robust, and inexpensive electrocatalysts with superaerophobic property for hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Herein, a cobalt phosphide nanowires array (CoP-NWA@CP) is grown on a carbon paper substrate as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for HzOR in alkaline medium, which features a superaerophobic surface that is highly anti-gaseous and conducive to nitrogen evolution (a gaseous byproduct of HzOR). The catalyst demonstrates significant HzOR performance with an onset potential of -97 mV (vs RHE), an ultralow overpotential of 82 mV@100 mA cm-2, and superior stability with little current density loss over 10,000 s at an overpotential of 0.42 V (vs RHE). The remarkable HzOR performance of the CoP-NWA@CP catalyst is attributed not only to its high intrinsic activity but also to its nanowire array design, which offers a large specific surface area, rapid electron and mass transfer, and superaerophobic surface wettability to expedite the release of N2 from the catalyst surface. Furthermore, a DHzFC is constructed using the CoP-NWA@CP catalyst as the anode and commercial MnO2 as the cathode, which delivers a high open-circult voltage of 0.905 V, a remarkable power density of 300 mW cm-2, and a power density retention of 95% after running for 12.5 h, indicating great potential candidature of CoP-NWA@CP for practical applications.\n###\n", "label": [[10, 1474, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT: The dysregulation of dopamine, a neuromodulator, is associated with a broad spectrum of brain disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s disease, addiction, and schizophrenia. Quantitative measurements of dopamine are essential for understanding dopamine functional dynamics. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is the most widely used electrochemical technique for measuring real-time in vivo dopamine level changes. Standard FSCV has only been used to analyze \u201cphasic dopamine\u201d (changes in seconds), because the gradual generation of background charging current is inevitable, and acts as the main noise source in the low-frequency band. Although \u201ctonic dopamine\u201d (changes in minutes to hours) is key for understanding the dopamine system, an electrochemical technique capable of simultaneously measuring phasic and tonic dopamine in an in vivo environment has not been established. Several modified voltammetric techniques have been developed for measuring tonic dopamine, but the sampling rates (0.1-0.05 Hz) are too low to be useful. Further investigation of the in vivo applicability of previously developed background drift removal methods for measuring tonic dopamine levels is required. We developed a second-derivative-based background removal (SDBR) method for simultaneously measuring phasic and tonic neurotransmitter levels in real-time. The performance of this technique was tested via in silico and in vitro tonic dopamine experiments. Furthermore, its applicability was tested in vivo. SDBR is a simple, robust, post-processing technique that can extract tonic neurotransmitter levels from all FSCV data. As SDBR is calculated in individual-scan voltammogram units, it can be applied to any real-time closed-loop system that uses a neurotransmitter as a biomarker.   Dopamine is a neuromodulator that conveys important information such as cognition, reward and pleasure, and voluntary motor movements.1, 2 Dysregulation of the dopamine system is associated with a broad spectrum of brain disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, addiction, and schizophrenia.1, 3, 4 Dopamine levels in the target areas of the brain display highly dynamic changes, with fluctuations on different timescales. These changes include rapid transients, which are ramps that may last for several seconds (phasic), and oscillations on the timescale of minutes to hours (tonic).22 Quantitative analysis of dopamine levels is crucial for learning about the functional role of dopamine dynamics in the normal brain, as well as studying brain-disorder pathology in pre-clinical and clinical studies.   Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with a carbon fiber microelectrode (CFM) is a well-established electrochemical technique that can effectively measure dopamine-level changes in the brain.55 FSCV measures faradaic current changes based on the dopamine oxidation peak voltage exhibited in a voltammogram, after subtracting the background current.66 The high scan rate of FSCV is sensitive enough to measure rapid changes in dopamine levels (phasic dopamine), but it also generates a progressively large background charging current (capacitive current), making it difficult to analyze voltammetry beyond 2 min.7, 8 The steady rise in the amplitude of the dopamine peak in FSCV due to this background charging current is called background drift. FSCV background drift makes it difficult to measure slow changes in dopamine levels (tonic dopamine).  Attempts to measure tonic dopamine levels in the brain in real-time are still challenging. Modified voltammetric techniques have been proposed for measuring tonic dopamine in vivo.9-12 These modified voltammetric techniques measure tonic dopamine levels, but the low temporal resolution (10\u201320 s) makes it difficult to analyze detailed dopamine signaling for understanding neuropsychiatric disorders. The high-pass filtering technique can measure phasic dopamine with background drift removed, but also removes tonic dopamine levels, which have a similar frequency band to that of the background drift.1313 Recently, tonic dopamine measurement using background drift removal was attempted using modified FSCV.14, 15 These methods attempted to estimate the background with an additional voltage waveform; however, estimating the background of the in vivo system with an electrode-specific training set still needs further investigation. An integration-based method estimates tonic dopamine by integrating around the dopamine peak of the background-subtracted voltammogram.1616 In this integration-based method, the user must set the integration potential range, causing potential bias in the estimated dopamine level, which can lead to inadequate estimates of tonic dopamine levels.  In this study, we developed a second-derivative-based background drift removal (SDBR) method for measuring phasic and tonic dopamine levels using standard FSCV. SDBR extracts tonic dopamine information by applying a second derivative from the dopamine oxidation peaks in the background-subtracted voltammogram. SDBR uses voltammetry measured with standard FSCV waveforms, so it provides additional tonic dopamine information to all FSCV studies that measure phasic dopamine. Since the second derivative is applied to individual voltammograms generated every 0.1 second, it can be applied to real-time systems. \n###\n", "label": [[10, 1781, "abstract"]]}

Molybdenum oxide was obtained by cathodic electrodeposition directly on binder free carbon nanotubes mats, followed by annealing of the electrode at 350\u00b0C under air. The resulting pseudocapacitive material has been characterized by SEM, XPS, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. The effect of heat treatment on the crystallinity and oxidation state of molybdenum oxide as well as on electrochemical performances were investigated. By optimizing synthesis conditions, a maximum capacitance of up to 274 F.g-1 has been obtained at 2 mV.s-1 in an organic electrolyte (LiTFSI/GBL 0.5M). A full asymmetric pseudocapacitor was then developed in association with a positive pseudocapacitive hybrid electrode material based on MnO2 mixed with rGO/CNT mats. Performances of this MoO3-CNTs||MnO2-rGO-CNTs hybrid system showed a high energy density of 23 Wh/kg with a power density up to 100 W/kg.\n###\n", "label": [[9, 1042, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "We studied changes in current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of organic solar cells (OSCs) with a ZnO electron-transport layer (ETL) with respect to illumination intensity and aging time. Unlike an encapsulated OSC that remained almost intact up to 195 hours, an unsealed OSC showed steady degradation. To elucidate the origin of long-term degradation, we carried out systematic simulations and identified six parameters that were responsible for aging effects in dark J-V curves. Among these six parameters, additional adjustments were necessary only for donor density and energy-barrier height, both of which were linked to a ZnO ETL, to reproduce a set of J-V curves concomitantly measured at 12 illumination conditions. We note that oxygen vacancies in ZnO behave as electron donors and, additionally, result in dipole-moment losses. Consequently, re-oxidation of a ZnO ETL, resulted from slow diffusion of ambient oxygen or water, lowered the electron quasi-Fermi level and increased the energy-barrier height. On the contrary, light-induced generation of oxygen vacancies, a short-term effect that disappear after turning illumination off, shifted the electron quasi-Fermi level upward and decreased the energy-barrier height. Because light-induced effects counteracted those of long-term re-oxidation, light intensity-dependent variations in J-V curves became more prominent with aging.\n###\n", "label": [[0, 1400, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT: It is commonly believed that active oxygen species over ABO3 perovskite play important role in improving the catalytic activity. In this paper, SrTiO3 (STO) was prepared, doped with extremely low concentration of NiP. By adjusting doping process, the content of three kinds of oxygen species can be transformed accordingly, which consequently influences the catalytic activity in water splitting under visible light irradiation. The transformation of oxygen species and improvement mechanism of hydrogen generation were investigated. XAFS, XAS and DFT calculation confirmed that Ni occupied Ti-sites and P coordinated with lattice oxygen on the STO surface. The structural evolution not only forms reactive lattice oxygen, but also regulates oxygen vacancy and adsorbed oxygen. The reactive lattice oxygen serves as the new reaction site during hydrogen evolution reaction. In conclusion, constructing reactive lattice oxygen and adjusting the ratio of different oxygen species are effective ways to fabricate high-performance photocatalyst for H2 evolution. \n###\n", "label": [[10, 1068, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT MOLECULAR MODELING CAN BE USED AS AN EXCELLENT TEACHING METHOD FOR PROVIDING BETTER INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISM OF FREE RADICAL REACTIONS. DUE TO ITS HIGHLY VISUAL NATURE, IT CAN AFFECT AND IMPROVE STUDENTS\u2019 PERCEPTION AND VISUALIZATION OF CHEMISTRY AT ALL THREE LEVELS (MACROSCOPIC, SYMBOLIC, AND MICROSCOPIC). THE MAJORITY OF CHEMISTRY STUDENTS WILL KNOW HOW TO REPRESENT A REACTION BETWEEN TWO FREE RADICALS SYMBOLICALLY (EITHER WITH ELECTRON PUSHING ARROWS OR WITH THE REPRESENTATION OF THE PAIRED AND UNPAIRED ELECTRONS). STUDENTS ALSO MEET WITH THE MACROSCOPIC LEVEL OF FREE RADICAL REACTIONS IN CHEMICAL LABORATORIES. HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM ARISES WHEN THEY ARE ASKED TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN THE RADICALS AT THE MICROSCOPIC LEVEL. IN SOME ELEMENTARY CHEMICAL REACTIONS THE REACTANTS AND PRODUCTS DIFFER IN SPIN MULTIPLICITY. THUS, THESE REACTIONS NEED TO BE DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF TWO-STATE REACTIVITY. SUCH A REACTION OCCURS ON TWO SPIN SURFACES AND INCLUDES SPIN INVERSION ALONG THE REACTION COORDINATE. IN THIS WORK, WE DEMONSTRATE A PROCEDURE WHICH AIMS TO EXPLAIN THE PROGRESSION OF A COUPLING REACTION BETWEEN TWO RADICALS YIELDING TOLUENE. THIS EXAMPLE SHOWCASES HOW ONE SINGLET MOLECULE CAN BE OBTAINED FROM TWO DOUBLETS. TO VERIFY THE IMPACT OF MOLECULAR MODELING ON STUDENTS\u2019 KNOWLEDGE ABOUT FREE RADICAL REACTIONS, WE CONDUCTED A STUDY THAT INVOLVED 44 CHEMISTRY STUDENTS. THE THREE QUESTIONNAIRES, TWO KNOWLEDGE TESTS (PRE-TEST AND POST-TEST), AND ONE SURVEY WERE CARRIED OUT FOR OBTAINING THE DATA.

{"text": "Abstract  To study the influence of pore structural properties of MOFs on drug adsorption and delivery, we synthesized two MOF termed TMU-6(RL1) ([Zn(oba)(RL1)0.5]n.(DMF)1.5) and TMU-21(RL2) ([Zn(oba)(RL2)0.5]n.(DMF)1.5) with amine basic N-donor pillars containing phenyl or naphthyl cores with various hydrophilic properties around the main center of the reaction. TG, IR, XPS and PXRD analyses were used to extensively characterize the MOFs. The synthesized carriers showed high adsorption efficiency, stability, and controlled release. As an anticancer drug, Nimesulide (Nim) was adsorbed to MOFs using multiple adsorption mechanisms, such as Host\u03c0\u2212\u03c0Guest interaction and HostN\u2212H\u22efOGuest hydrogen bonds. Moreover, Hirshfeld surface analysis showed when the benzene core was replaced with the naphthalene core, the percentage of interactions intermolecular of \u03c0...\u03c0 and N\u2026H by amine sites in TMU-21(RL2) decreased compared with TMU-6(RL1), while the percentage of these interactions with guest molecules increased. The results showed that changes in the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity properties of MOFs would alter their ability to adsorb Nim in the pore of the frameworks. In vitro anticancer studies also showed that the cytotoxicity of Nim in MOFs@Nim composites against HeLa cells (Human cervical cancer cell line) and HT-29 cells (Human colon cancer cell line) is much higher than that of free Nim. Generally, based on the results, it can be said that the biological behavior of carriers can be regulated by adjusting the structure properties of MOFs.\n###\n", "label": [[10, 1557, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "Abstract: Molecular structures, packings, and intermolecular interactions significantly affect the photophysical properties of organic luminogens. In this work, the photoluminescence (PL) and mechanoluminescence (ML) of two pairs of isomers, 1/2 and 3/4, were systematically explored. The fluorescence of crystal 1c and 4c is much brighter than that of their isomer 2c and 3c, respectively. While only 1c is ML-active among all four molecules. Single-crystal structural analysis revealed that isomerization of substituent group affected their molecular packing and intermolecular interactions. Stronger intermolecular interaction and intact three dimensional hydrogen-bonded networks were only formed in crystal 1c, which were essential for preventing slippage of molecular layers and generating ML; while the rest molecules were either lacking of \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions or C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interaction. Theoretical calculation suggested that the energy barrier between Franck-Condon (FC) structure and minimum energy crossing point (MECP) structure of 2/3 was much lower than that of 1/4. Nonradiative decay channels of molecules 2/3 were thus more easily activated and led to their lower quantum yield.\n###\n", "label": [[10, 1189, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT: Supercapacitors have received great attention in the energy storage of flexible wearable electronic products due to its fast charging and discharging. However, low energy density and poor rate performance have always been the main factors limiting its application. Herein, by adjusting the ratio of Ni and Co, the optimized porous nanoflower-like Ni/Co layered double hydroxides (LDH) deliver a large specific capacitance value of 1575 F\u00b7g\u22121 at 1 A g-1 and superior rate performance with 86.3% capacity retention from 1 to 50 A g-1. The superior electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the transfer of electrons from Co to Ni, resulting in an increase in more conductive Co3+ and more active Ni2+. Simultaneously, rich porosity and wider interlayer spacing of Ni/Co LDH facilitate easy electrolyte access and fast ion diffusion within active materials. By combining with screen printing, a flexible Ni3Co1 LDH@graphene//activated carbon (Ni3Co1 LDH@G//AC) asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated, exhibiting outstanding specific areal capacitance of 599 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm\u22122, excellent areal energy density (0.27 mWh cm-2) and power density (49.9 mW cm-2). Moreover, the capacity of ASC remains 95.8%, even bending to different angles and for 400 times, showing excellent flexibility. After two ASCs are connected in series and packaged, it can power a watch for more than 60 min after only charging for 50 s, and even the device is worn on the hand and completely submerged in water, it can still power the watch normally. This work provides inspiration for large-scale production of high-performance supercapacitors and the integration of supercapacitors into wearable electronic products.\n###\n", "label": [[10, 1719, "abstract"]]}

Herein, we report a synergistic, transition metal ion F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (tmFRET) and native ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) based approach to probe the gas-phase structures of a non-stapled (nsp) and a stapled peptide (sp) ions. Fluorescence lifetime measurements indicated that the Cu2+ complexes of sp-crh6g have shorter donor-acceptor distance (rDA) values than nsp-crh6g. The experimental collision cross-section (CCS) values were then determined in native IM-MS, which can separate conformations of the Cu2+ complexes of nsp-crh6g and sp-crh6g. The experimental CCS (i.e., shape) and rDA (i.e., distance) values were then used as constraints in conjunction with computational studies, which unambiguously revealed that a staple effectively reduces the elongation of the peptide ions in the gas phase. This study demonstrates the superiority of combining native IM-MS, tmFRET and computation to investigate the conformational dynamics of biomolecular ions. ### \n###\n", "label": [[296, 1555, "abstract"]]}

In this study, we formulated novel microalgae diets using Chlorella vulgaris and Arthrospira platensis (spirulina) biomass and fed them to young adult honey bee workers. Diet-induced changes in bee metabolite profiles were studied relative to a natural pollen diet using LC- and GC-MS metabolomics approaches. The metabolomes of pollen- and microalgae-fed bees exhibited notable overlap, particularly upon subtraction of unique diet features. Untargeted and targeted analyses identified a wide variety of metabolites that were influenced by diet, including complex lipids, essential fatty acids, and bioactive phytochemicals. The metabolomics results are useful to understand mechanisms underlying favorable growth performance as well as increased antioxidant and heat shock protein gene expression in bees fed the microalgae diets. We conclude that the tested microalgae have potential as sustainable feed additives and health-modulating natural products. Metabolomics-guided diet development could eventually help tailor feed interventions to achieve precision nutrition in honey bees and, more broadly, other livestock animals. ### \n###\n", "label": [[234, 1541, "abstract"]]}

In order to further systematically disclose the structure-activity relationship, a series of the benzoyl arylamines were designed and prepared. Their structures were characterized and fungicidal activities against Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici and Fusarium graminearum were evaluated. The results indicated that the structure of N-heterocyclic group, the substituted group and their position on the benzamide scaffold had an important influence on the activities as predicted. Finally, compound 18f was found to show excellent activities against G. graminis var. tritici, F. graminearum, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium pseudograminearum and Fusarium moniliforme with a half maximum effective concentration of 0.002, 0.093, 0.011, 0.881 and 0.287 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. These results proposed that the compound 18f deserved serious consideration as a novel candidate fungicide for the control of wheat root diseases. ### \n###\n", "label": [[514, 1622, "abstract"], [429, 486, "affiliation"], [488, 504, "address"]]}

The resulting generation of conduction band electrons gives rise to high electric conductivity and strong optical absorption in the near infrared region. Chemically, SnO2:Sb possesses the electrocatalytic activities for two electron-oxygen reduction reaction (2e--ORR) with the extraordinary low affinity for H2O2 and one electron-water oxidation reaction (1e--WOR). Owing to these unique properties, SnO2:Sb are currently finding its applications for green and sustainable chemistry. This Feature article outlines the fundamentals and applications of SnO2:Sb. The fundamental parts deal with the three dimensional single-atom-catalyst-like character of SnO2:Sb and the electrocatalytic activities for 2e--ORR and 1e--WOR. In the subsequent application parts, SnO2:Sb\u2013catalyzed electrochemical and photocatalytic reactions including hydrogen peroxide synthesis, low-temperature oxidative organic transformations, and decomposition of organic water pollutants are described with the photothermal catalytic reactions. Finally, the conclusions and future prospects are summarized.

The kinetic fragility m of polymers was thus verified to link with thermodynamic parameters of Tg\u00b7\u0394Cp/\u0394HR, as predicted by Adam\u2013Gibbs equation. In this work, enthalpy hysteresis of poly(n-alkyl methacrylate)s was investigated systematically to clarify whether \u0394HR is influenced by multifarious non-\u03b1-related contributions. The results showed that the \u0394HR for higher poly(n-alkyl methacrylate)s are abnormally suppressed, as manifested by failure of the theoretic correlation between m and Tg\u00b7\u0394Cp/\u0394HR. The anomalous suppression appears non-related to the \u03b2JG-relaxation but stems from nanophase separation of the alkyl side-chains. Once the PE-like nanophase is completely destroyed, either by increasing the steric hindrance of side groups or by introducing small molecule-bridged hydrogen bonds, \u0394HR recovers and the theoretic correlation between m and Tg\u00b7\u0394Cp/\u0394HR is re-established. Further experiments revealed that the abnormal \u0394HR suppression occurs only when the size of alkyl nanodomains is comparable to the cooperative rearrangement region of bulk \u03b1-relaxation at Tg. Accordingly, the deviation of m and Tg\u00b7\u0394Cp/\u0394HR correlations from the theoretic prediction must be related to the existence of two different but partly coupled glass transitions in higher poly(n-alkyl methacrylate)s. The extremely hindered and confined glass transition in the PE-like nanodomains is likely to cause the anomalous suppression of global enthalpy hysteresis.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[177, 1913, "abstract"]]}

In this work, we use a geomechanical-coupled gas flow (GCF) model to simulate and analyze the pre-extraction effect of mining-disturbed coal seam. Firstly, the simulation results of GCF model are compared with field test data to verify the correctness and reliability of our model. Then, the evolution law of the stress field, permeability field and gas flow field in the extraction process is analyzed through a case study. The results show that the first principal stress of coal in mining area increases first and then decreases slowly, and reaches the peak value at 5 m. The third principal stress increases gradually at first and becomes stable after 10 m. As the distance from the mining face increases, the permeability and gas pressure of coal seam show continuous and asymmetric \"U\" shaped and \"n\" shaped distribution characteristics respectively. In addition, the recovery effect and abnormal emission factors of CBM are discussed. This study can provide theoretical guidance for optimizing the CBM recovery effect and reducing GHG emissions during mining.

XRD, TG, SEM, TEM, XPS and BET characterizations of this materials were carried out, and it was found that the introduction and elution of template molecules did not destroy the structure of the original MOFs, and the pore size of MIP-MOFs reached the mesoporous level. Furthermore, according to adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm, the adsorption rate of MIP-MOFs for Norfloxacin increased by more than three times compared with the original MOFs, and the maximum adsorption capacity reached to 684 mg\u00b7g-1. Additionally, the selective adsorption experiment showed that the MIP-MOFs had excellent selective adsorption capacity, which is mainly attributed to the specific recognition ability of three-dimensional imprinted holes to template molecules. This study provides a feasible strategy for the application of MOFs in the high-efficiency selective adsorption and removal of macromolecules such as antibiotics. ### \n###\n", "label": [[129, 1241, "abstract"]]}

Among the different available plasticizers, ionic liquids (ILs) have captured much interest due to their extremely low vapor pressure, high chemical, thermal, and electrochemical stability. Plasticizing polymerized ionic liquid (PIL)-based electrolytes with ILs may lead to intrinsically safe and highly ionically conductive GPEs even at low temperature. Herein, we report the fundamental properties of some representative PIL-based GPEs utilizing sulfonimide anions ([N(SO2RF1)(SO2RF2)]\u2212; RF1, RF2 = F or CF3), aiming to provide a detailed understanding of the diffusion and conduction properties of these intriguing electrolyte family when different anions are involved. Our results suggest that the full bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI)-based system exhibits higher ionic conductivities and better selectivity in cationic transport as compared to other systems, due to the higher mobility of free ions and the lower content in ion aggregates. It is anticipated that the present work may set the course to design new GPEs rendering an overall improved electrochemical performance. TOC GRAPHICS ### \n###\n", "label": [[403, 1623, "abstract"]]}

Quantification of excited-state pKa, pKa*, is critical in predicting excited-state proton-transfer behavior. F\u00f6rster cycle analysis provides a reasonable approximation of pKa*, but only when an accurate value of the ground-state pKa is known. This poses a challenge for the study of weak photoacids (photobases) with less acidic (basic) excited states (pKa* (pKb*) > 7), because their ground-state pKa (pKb*) values are often >20, making it difficult to quantify them accurately in water. Another common method to determine pKa* relies on acid\u2013base titrations with photoluminescence detection. This method requires that excited-state chemical quasi-equilibrium is reached, which does not occur for weak photoacids (photobases) due to slow rates of excited-state proton transfer. Herein, we report a method to overcome these limitations. We demonstrate that liquid water and aqueous hydroxide are unique and independent proton-accepting quenchers of excited-state photoacids. We also determine that Stern\u2013Volmer quenching analyses result in accurate observed rate constants for excited-state proton transfer to a series of proton-accepting quenchers. Analysis of these data by a Rehm\u2013Weller-type method coupled to Marcus theory yields an accurate value for pKa* of a weak photoacid. Our work constitutes a unique contribution, because our method only requires readily-available steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy. Moreover, our analyses and results for weak photoacids are consistent with those from previous studies of strong photoacids, each showing the applicability of Marcus theory and related theories to interpret driving-force-dependent kinetic data for proton-transfer reactions. ### \n###\n", "label": [[266, 2092, "abstract"]]}

Although it is one of the most powerful methods for individual compound detection, complete signal assignment in complex mixtures is still a major challenge. The unconstrained formula-generating algorithm, covering the entire spectra and revealing all compounds, is a \u201cdream tool\u201d for researchers. We present the framework for efficient MS data interpretation, describing a novel approach for complete and comprehensive analysis based on gradient-boosted decision trees and a neural network that generates molecular formulas from the fine isotopic structure, solving the long-standing inverse spectra problem. The workflow was successfully employed in three areas: fragment ion analysis in protein sequencing for proteomics, analysis of the natural samples for life sciences, and study of the cross-coupling catalytic system for chemistry. ### \n###\n", "label": [[259, 1330, "abstract"]]}

Stoerzinger symbols: '[1, 4, z]'  --- Abstract Electrocatalysis is a promising approach to convert waste nitrate to ammonia and help close the nitrogen cycle. This renewably-powered ammonia production process sources hydrogen from water (as opposed to methane in the thermal Haber-Bosch process), but requires a delicate balance between a surfaces\u2019 activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), influencing Faradaic efficiency (FE) and selectivity to ammonia/ammonium over other nitrogen-containing products. We measure ammonium FEs ranging from 3.6\u00b16.6% (on Ag) to 93.7\u00b10.9% (on Co) across a range of transition metals (TMs; Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, Ni0.68Cu0.32, Cu, and Ag) in buffered neutral media. To better understand these competing reaction kinetics, we develop a microkinetic model that captures the voltage-dependent nitrate rate order and illustrates its origin as competitive adsorption between nitrate and hydrogen adatoms (H*). NO3RR FE can be described via competition for electrons with the HER, decreasing sharply for TMs with high work function and correspondingly high HER activity (e.g. Ni). Ammonium selectivity nominally increases as TM d-band center energy (Ed) approaches and overcomes the Fermi level (EF), but is exceptionally high for Co compared to materials with similar Ed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate Co maximizes ammonium selectivity via (1) strong nitrite binding enabling subsequent reduction and (2) promotion of nitric oxide dissociation, leading to selective reduction of the nitrogen adatom (N*) to ammonium.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[327, 19, "abstract"]]}

To date, dozens of organic-inorganic multiferroics have been reported; however, most of them show magnetic Curie temperature much lower than room temperature, which drastically hampers their application. Here, by performing first-principle calculations and building effective model Hamiltonians, we reveal a molecule-orbital-mediated magnetic coupling mechanism in two-dimensional Cr(pyz)2 (pyz=pyrazine), and the role that the valence state of the molecule plays in determining the magnetic coupling type between metal ions. Based on these, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional organic-inorganic room-temperature multiferroic, Cr(h-fpyz)2 (h-fpyz= half-fluoropyrazine), can be rationally designed by introducing ferroelectricity in Cr(pyz)2 while keeping the valence state of the molecule unchanged. Our work not only reveals the origin of magnetic coupling in 2D organic-inorganic systems, but also provides a way to design room temperature multiferroic materials rationally. ### \n###\n", "label": [[263, 1334, "abstract"]]}

Worldwide, regulations typically limit only carcinogenic inorganic As, but not possibly carcinogenic dimethylated oxyarsenate (DMA). However, there is emerging evidence that \u201cDMA\u201d, determined by routine acid-based extraction and analysis, hides a substantial share of dimethylated thioarsenates which are similar to or higher in cytotoxicity than arsenite. Risk assessments characterizing the in vivo toxicity of rice-derived dimethylated thioarsenates are urgently needed. In the meantime, either more sophisticated methods based on enzymatic extraction and separation of dimethylated oxy- and thioarsenates have to become mandatory or total As should be regulated.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[201, 933, "abstract"]]}

The influence of dietary patterns on bioavailable metals, gut microbes, their interaction, and then human health is still unknown. A biomimetic whole digestive tract (mouth, stomach, small and large intestine) with full functions (digestion, metabolism, and absorption) is constructed to transform the diets into chyme, gut microbiota is cultured with corresponding chyme, and then bioavailable metals and microbiota are tested. The diet species-specificity in bioavailable metal content, the positive and negative correlations between bioavailable metals and microbial reproduction are disclosed. When HC-LFP is replaced by LC-HFP for 21 days, the reproduction of harmful and benefit microbes is increased and decreased significantly respectively, which induce the prevalence of obesity, inflammation, septicemia, and cancer, and then the risk of dietary pattern shift is disclosed. ### \n###\n", "label": [[294, 1338, "abstract"]]}

Ferrer symbols: '[2, 6]' - name: Carlos Sanchez symbols: '[2, 6]'  --- Abstract The sulfuration of metallic iron layers into pyrite (FeS2) is preceded by an initial stage characterized by the iron transformation into monosulfide, which acts as a precursor of the disulfide. This work presents a comprehensive reaction and kinetic model of the sulfuration reaction of metallic iron thin films into monosulfides when using a molecular sulfur (S2) atmosphere. By slowing down the sulfuration reaction, we have been able to follow in-situ the evolution of the transport properties (electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient) of the films during their sulfuration reaction to monosulfides. We show that two different processes characterize this initial sulfuration stage: (1) the transformation of Fe into hexagonal pyrrhotite (Fe \u2192 Fe1-xSH), and (2) a partial crystallographic transformation of this hexagonal pyrrhotite into orthorhombic pyrrhotite (Fe1-xSH \u2192 Fe1-xSO). A two-steps process can explain the pyrrhotite hexagonal phase formation, being firstly controlled by the surface adsorption of S2 on the external sample interface (S2/pyrrhotite) and secondly by the diffusion of Fe atoms through the formed pyrrhotite layer. By deducing the corresponding kinetic equations in terms of the experimental parameters (S2 partial pressure and thicknesses of the layers of present species), we can explain the evolution of the electrical resistance and Seebeck coefficient of the original Fe film during its transformation into monosulfide. At the same time, the appearance of the Kirkendall effect during the monosulfide phase formation is experimental and formally justified. Finally, we propose new insights on the development of possible defects on pyrite films obtained by transformation of the monosulfides (i.e. sulfur excess in the film or the presence of a porous layer at the pyrite/substrate interface). These results may lead to a future better control of the pyrite film properties by carefully selecting the experimental conditions during its growth.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[473, 2457, "abstract"]]}

Recent efforts to enhance their photoluminescence (PL) intensity have profound importance to device efficiency. Enhanced PL spectra are always accompanied by large asymmetric broadening, and the recombination mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, the emission of ZnO thin films is enhanced by Ar and H2 plasma treatments, showing an increase of 30-fold in the intensity and 4-fold in the full width at half maximum (FWHM). The systematic time-resolved photoluminescence measurements illustrate an extraordinary recombination mechanism, as a wide range of photon energies possess identical dynamic features and temperature dependent characteristics. The asymmetric broadening is attributed to strong electron-phonon coupling introduced by the variation of carrier distribution. As a theoretical confirmation, the Multimode Brownian Oscillator (MBO) model is used to quantitatively describe the line shape of spectra with a perfect agreement and evaluate the coupling strength between the primary oscillator and LO phonon. The recombination mechanism of enhanced and broadened PL spectrum is applicable to other materials with strongly phonon interaction, which will be beneficial to improving the performance of optoelectronic devices.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[178, 1516, "abstract"]]}

Here we report a n-TiO2/Aluminum (Al) nanodisk/p-GaN photoelectrode sandwich device that exhibits enhanced H2 generation efficiencies due to a combination of plasmon-enhanced processes: hot carriers are generated through direct excitation enhanced by the plasmonic near field, and hot electrons are also generated in the illuminated Al nanodisk and injected into the conduction band of the TiO2 layer. The hot carriers are subsequently transferred into water molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, driving H2 evolution. The photocurrent densities we observe are nearly an order of magnitude higher than in an equivalent device with the Al nanodisk replaced by a Au nanodisk of the same size, and are on par or better than previous reports of plasmonic photoelectrodes using Au nanoparticles in combination with co-catalyst species.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[290, 1329, "abstract"]]}

Ti3C2Tx, as one of the two dimensional (2D) MXene materials, shows great potential in the field of microwave absorbing. However, MXene has problems of impedance mismatch, narrow absorption bandwidth, and poor absorbing performances. In the research, we designed a series of ZIF-8/MXene-based microwave absorbing materials marked as porous ZnO/MXene nanocomposites, which were synthesized by in-situ composite method before being annealed under vacuum. And then the structure and performances of porous ZnO/MXene were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and vector network analyzer (VNA). We investigated influences of samples\u2019 mass ratio in composition, microstructure, morphology, and microwave absorbing performances upon raw materials. As results, ZnO/MXene nanocomposites with the mass ratio of Zn2+: MXene=2: 1 had the optimal microwave absorbing performance. The minimum reflection loss was -34.31 dB at 8.8 GHz (thickness 1.0 mm), and the effective absorption bandwidth was 3.47 GHz from 13.49 to 16.96 GHz. ### \n###\n", "label": [[197, 1451, "abstract"]]}

The hot carrier lifetime increases with excitation photon energy due to the hot phonon bottleneck. By inducing the Auger heating effect, wherein the carrier-carrier interact to transfer energy under higher absorbed photon flux, the hot carrier lifetime also prolongs. When these two effects are combined under higher excitation photon energy and higher absorbed photon flux, the hot phonon bottleneck effect is gradually quenched due to photoionization, when the carrier energy state position rises. In addition, the hot carrier phenomenon can be observed in different excitonic states simultaneously. Our work establishes a solid photo-physics foundation for 2D-transition metal dichalcogenides applications in advanced energy conversion, optical quantum communication, and quantum technology, in particular, breaking the Schockley-Queisser limit to achieve hot carrier solar cells.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[344, 1426, "abstract"]]}

Yet, it is limited by the energy loss due to the reabsorption problem. The way of integrating binary complementary color phosphors with n-UV LED chips can be a good solution with several advantages. Developing yellow-emitting phosphors with superior performances are the key for this solution. In this work, we have designed and prepared Rb2Sr1-yCayP2O7: xEu2+ solid solutions with yellow-orange color-tunable luminescence. The crystal structure, band structure, luminescent properties and the potential applications for WLEDs were explored in detail. Under n-UV light excitation, the phosphors efficiently emit broadband yellow-orange emission with the full width at half maximum of about 130 nm. The phosphors show little absorption in the blue region, which can avoid reabsorption. The reasons and mechanisms of the variation of the PL/PLE spectra have also been investigated. The optimal Rb2SrP2O7: 0.5%Eu2+ sample exhibits a high quantum efficiency (QE) of 72.96% with a good color purity of 87.1%. By combining the BAM: Eu2+ and Rb2SrP2O7: 0.5%Eu2+ phosphors with a 380 nm n-UV chip, a WLED device is fabricated and can emit bright white light with a CIE of (0.344, 0.333), a high CRI of 88.4 and a low CCT of 4425 K.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[175, 1544, "abstract"]]}

Johnston symbols: '[*]'  --- ABSTRACT: The effects of composition, size, and phase state on ultrafine seed particle growth by \u237a-pinene ozonolysis were determined from diameter growth measurements after a fixed reaction time in a flow tube reactor. Modeling time-dependent particle growth under a given set of conditions allowed the reaction growth yield (GY) to be determined, which is defined as the fraction of \u237a-pinene molecules that react to give a product that grows the particle. Growth yields were compared for initial seed particle diameters of 40 nm, 60 nm, and 80 nm that were composed of effloresced ammonium sulfate, deliquesced ammonium sulfate, and effloresced \u237a-pinene SOA. Overall, the SOA seed particles gave the lowest growth yields. Effloresced ammonium sulfate particles gave somewhat higher growth yields and showed a slight dependence on relative humidity. Deliquesced ammonium sulfate particles gave the highest growth yields. Seed particle size dependencies suggested that both surface- and volume- limited reactions may contribute to growth. Overall, the growth yield was found to vary by more than a factor of four across the reaction conditions studied. The results highlight the crucial role that particle characteristics play in determining particle growth rates in a size range relevant to formation of cloud condensation nuclei. ### \n###\n", "label": [[208, 1528, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "author_list: - name: Krzysztof Pyrchla symbols: '[a, z]' - name: Robert Bogdanowicz symbols: '[a]'  --- Abstract. Nanoribbons are crucial nanostructures due to their superior mechanical and electrical properties. This paper is devoted to hybrid studies of the elastic mechanical anisotropy of phosphorene nanoribbons whose edges connect the terminals of devices such as bridges. Fundamental mechanical properties, including Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density, were estimated from first-principles calculations for 1-layer, 3-layer, and 6-layer nanoribbons with widths of 10 \u00c5. The data achieved from the ab initio simulations supplied the finite element model (FEM) of the nanoribbons. The strain pressure curves' directional coefficients were estimated as Young's effective modulus since the structure is 1D. The modulus values were equal to 85.8, 111.8, and 134 GPa for 6, 3 and 1 layers, respectively. Moreover, the variation in Poisson's coefficient for the armchair direction was significantly smaller than for the zigzag direction. Monotonic changes in this twist were observed for structures with 3 and 6 layers within the plane along the zigzag axis. The phosphorene nanoribbons subjected to periodic excitation behaved similarly to those subjected to static loading, while their whippiness was inversely proportional to the length. Next, the deflection under the static force, the resonance frequencies, and the response to a variable driving force were calculated. ### \n###\n", "label": [[114, 1485, "abstract"]]}

Smith symbols: '[*, a]'  --- ABSTRACT: This work reports a combined experimental and computational study of the activation of an otherwise catalytically inactive cobalt complex ([Co(TIM)Br2]+) for aqueous nitrite reduction. The presence of phosphate buffer cocatalyst leads to efficient electrocatalysis, with rapid reduction to ammonium occurring close to the thermodynamic potential and with high Faradaic efficiency. At neutral pH, increasing buffer concentrations increase catalytic current while simultaneously decreasing overpotential, although high concentrations have an inhibitory effect. Controlled potential electrolysis and rotating ring-disk electrode experiments indicate that ammonium is directly produced from nitrite by [Co(TIM)Br2]+, along with small quantities of hydroxylamine. Mechanistic investigations implicate a vital role for the phosphate buffer, specifically as a proton shuttle, although high buffer concentrations inhibit catalysis due to anation of the catalyst, which increases the overpotential for nitrite reduction. These results indicate a role for buffer as part of the catalyst design strategy in nitrogen oxide electrocatalysis.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[224, 1352, "abstract"]]}

In density functional theory calculations, the frontier MOs of these complexes were found to be stabilized relative to model complexes with electron-withdrawing atoms or moieties on the meso-aryl rings. Electrochemical measurements suggest that electrodes with CN-CoPor (CN-CoPor/C) exhibit the most positive ORR potential values and the highest limiting current density in both acidic and alkali electrolytes, while the F-CoPor/C electrocatalyst exhibits extremely low ORR performance. The electron transfer numbers for the electrocatalysts are more than 3.0, indicating that a mixture of 2- and 4-electron transfer pathways occurs. The results demonstrate that coupling the hydrogen bonding properties and electron-withdrawing abilities through rational design of the substituent at the meso-position is an efficient way to modify the ORR performance. ### \n###\n", "label": [[319, 1450, "abstract"]]}

Inspired by the design of naturally occurring enzymes which are efficient catalysts for O2 and H2O2 reduction, several artificial systems have been generated where different 2nd sphere residues have been installed to enhance the rate and efficiency of the 4e-/4H+ O2 reduction. These include hydrogen bonding residues like amines, carboxylates, ether, amides, phenols etc. In some cases, improvements in the catalysis where recorded whereas in some cases improvements were marginal or non-existent. In this work we use an iron porphyrin complex with pendant 1,10-phenanthroline residues which show a pH dependent variation of rate of electrochemical O2 reduction reaction (ORR) over two orders of magnitude. In situ surface enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy reveal the presence of different intermediates at different pH\u2019s reflecting different rate determining steps at different pH\u2019s. These data in conjunction with density functional theory calculations reveal that, when the distal 1,10-phenanthroline is neutral it acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor which stabilizes H2O (product) binding to the active FeII state and retards the reaction. However, when the 1,10-phenanthroline is protonated, it acts as a hydrogen bonding donor which enhances O2 reduction by stabilizing FeIII-O2- and FeIII-OOH intermediates and activating the O-O bond for cleavage. Based on these data general guidelines for controlling the different possible rate determining steps in the complex multi-step 4e-/4H+ ORR is developed and bio-inspired principle-based design of efficient electrochemical ORR is presented. ### \n###\n", "label": [[261, 2064, "abstract"]]}

Unexpectedly, these complexes self-assembled into nanoparticles upon dilution in biological media. This behavior leads to their accumulation in lysosomes following their internalization by cells. While a significant increase in cellular uptake was observed for the biotin-conjugated complexes, it did not result in an increase in their phototoxicity. However, their high phototoxicity upon irradiation at long wavelengths (645-670 nm) and their self-assembling behavior make them promising backbone for the development of new lysosome-targeted photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy. ### \n###\n", "label": [[253, 1097, "abstract"]]}

Three-dimensional porous copper foam (Cuf) when electrochemically decorated with transition metal selenide results in a highly active electrocatalyst for adequate water electrolysis. In terms of water splitting, the role of cobalt selenide and Cuf has already proven to be remarkable. The introduction of Ni-buffer layer between Cuf and cobalt selenide (Cuf@Ni-CoSe2) acts as a valve to enhance the electron thrust from the substrate to the material surface with no compromise in the overall material conductivity, which not only increases the efficiency and activity but also improves the stability of the catalyst. The self-supported synthesized catalyst material was turned up to show an admirable activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. The performance of the catalyst was identified to be significantly better than the noble catalyst RuO2. The catalyst was very stable up to 107 h and attained a full cell voltage of only 1.52 V at a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Therefore, for large-scale hydrogen production, this as-synthesized catalyst holds the potential for replacing conventional fossil fuel-based energy systems.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[191, 1583, "abstract"]]}

Here, a transient hot-wire technique was used to measure liquid thermal conductivities of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide [EMIm][Tf2N] and 1-n-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide [HMIm][Tf2N] in vapor-liquid equilibrium with the hydrofluorocarbon gas, 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (R-134a), at 298.15, 323.15, and 348.15 K for [HMIm][Tf2N] and 298.15, 348.15, 398.15 K for [EMIm][Tf2N] and pressures to 28 bar. The thermal conductivity of the gas-saturated ionic liquid exhibits a very small and relatively linear decrease with increasing pressure (composition) of R-134a even to relatively high compositions (~80% mole). Only at very high molar compositions of the gas (~90+%mol), does the thermal conductivity significantly decrease towards that of the value of pure liquid R-134a. However, no simple mixing rule of the pure component properties could correlate the trends in composition. As some potential applications require higher temperatures, the system of [EMIm][Tf2N]/R-134a was measured at 398.15K. Generally, a longer alkyl-chain length on the cation ([HMIm][Tf2N]) experiences a steeper decrease in thermal conductivity with increasing R-134a compositions than with the [EMIm] cation.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[118, 1532, "abstract"]]}

Maginn symbols: '[2, *]' - name: Burcu Gurkan symbols: '[1, *]'  --- Abstract The solvation structure and transport properties of Li+ in ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes based on n-methyl-n-butylpyrrolidinium cyano(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide [PYR14][CTFSI] and [Li][CTFSI] (0 \u2264 xLi \u2264 0.7) were studied by Raman and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. At xLi < 0.3, Li+ coordination is dominated by the cyano group. As xLi is increased, free cyano-sites becomes limited, resulting in increased coordination via sulfonyl group. The 1:1 mixture of the symmetric anions bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([TFSI]) and dicyanamide ([DCA]) results in similar physical properties to the IL with [CTFSI]. However, anion asymmetry is shown to increase Li-salt solubility and promote Li+ transference. The lifetimes of Li+-cyano coordination for [CTFSI] are calculated to be shorter than for [DCA], indicating the competition from the sulfonyl group weakens its solvation with Li+. This resulted in higher Li+ transference for the electrolyte with [CTFSI]. In relation to the utility of these electrolytes in energy storage, the Li-LiFePO4 half cells assembled with IL electrolyte (xLi=0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) demonstrated a nominal capacity of 140 mAh/g at 0.1C rate and 90 \u00b0C where the cell with xLi=0.7 IL electrolyte demonstrated 61% capacity retention after 100 cycles and superior rate capability owing to increased electrochemical stability. ### \n###\n", "label": [[345, 1754, "abstract"]]}

Different energy sources viz., microwave, thermal and UV-visible light as reaction initiator were compared and studied their roles in facilitating the catalytic reactions. Interestingly under the microwave irradiation and 250 W visible light, the newly developed ionic liquid was found to be a benchmark catalyst in this study which showed a breakthrough in catalytic performances, enabling the quantitative yield of the desired products. The reaction affords excellent yield under thermal condition also, however prolonged heating (8 hours) at 120 oC is essentially required in this case. 2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one was attained through one pot oxidative synthesis led by the ionic liquid using TBHP as an oxidant in just 3.5 minutes incorporating microwave irradiation. On the other hand, the quantitative yields of the products were obtained in 4 hours at room temperature under photochemical condition. Further metal/solvent/base free in-situ oxidation of benzyl alcohols to corresponding aldehydes using the designed ionic liquid adds a golden touch to the task-specificity of the ionic liquid. The multifunctional behavior of the IL was reestablished from the fact that it is also very much effective in the synthesis of two Wnt pathway antagonists in 3.5 minutes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of metal/external acid-base/ ligand free protocol for oxidative synthesis of quinazolinones and oxidation of benzyl alcohol. ### \n###\n", "label": [[250, 1967, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "author_list: - name: Franklin Tao symbols: '[*]' - name: Luan Nguyen symbols: '[N/A]' - name: Yu Tang symbols: '[N/A]'  --- Abstract We reported the finding of the photoelectron-induced excitation (PEIE) spectroscopy and its correlation with fundamental studies of catalysis. Spectrum of PEIE is formed through scattering free molecules of the on-site gas phase proximal to a catalyst surface by an electron source generated from the catalyst surface. The electron source is these photoelectrons with a specific kinetic energy released from the catalyst surface such as C 1s photoelectrons from graphite or Pt 4f7/2 from a Pt catalyst. Graphite, Ag, Pt, and Au were used as model catalysts; CO, O2, N2, or their mixtures were used as a pure gas or a gas mixture around a catalyst surface. A constituting peak in a PEIE spectrum is contributed from photoelectrons which lose certain amount of kinetic energy () after scattering free molecules of the on-site gas phase proximal to the catalyst surface. By measuring kinetic energy () of these photoelectrons after scattering with gaseous molecules, are identified. As is the energy used for exciting free molecules from their ground state to a specific excitation state, the identification of of these peaks of a PEIE spectrum allows to build the energy diagram of molecular orbitals of the on-site gas phase proximal to the catalyst surface. With the composed energy diagram of a molecule, molecular identity of the gas can be identified by comparing it to references. As intensity of a PEIE spectrum is proportional to molecular density in terms of pressure of the on-site gas phase, PEIE spectroscopy can measure pressure of a gas and analyze composition of an on-site gas mixture proximal to a catalyst surface. It is expected that PEIE spectroscopy is particularly valuable for high-temperature catalysis since component and composition of the on-site high-temperature gas phase proximal to the high-temperature catalyst surface can be different from the off-site gas phase at low temperature or room temperature. Since the parent peaks of a PEIE extended spectrum represent surface chemistry of the catalyst and the PEIE difference spectrum provides information on molecular identity, and partial pressure of constituting gases of the on-site gas mixture, the integration of PEIE spectroscopy to ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy offers a significant function of both characterizing a catalyst surface and simultaneously measuring on-site catalytic performance of the catalyst during catalysis for fundamental understanding of a catalytic reaction in a manner of spatial proximity and temporal simultaneity. ### \n###\n", "label": [[133, 2677, "abstract"]]}

Bottom-up manufacturing is essentially the assembly of smaller structural units such as atoms, molecules, nanoparticles or wires into relatively large and complex structural systems. While the assembly process relies on reliable and efficient nano-connections or interfacial contacts, which restricts the transformation process of nano-functional materials to practical applications. Aiming at this purpose, interfacial behavior and atomic structures of self-limiting covalent joining carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by femtosecond laser irradiation method were investigated. Experimental results show that the defects of CNTs are firstly reduced with the increase of the laser fluence. As the laser energy reaches 39.216 mJ/cm2, two CNTs in physical contact are successfully interconnected with covalent bonds with a small necking near the joint. The irradiation parameters of the femtosecond pulse laser are obtained for the optimal connection of two separated CNTs. Molecular dynamics simulation reveal that how the two separated CNTs evolve into a covalent nano-junction dominated by sp2 bonds and there is a high connection strength at the connection node. This covalent interconnection method, if further expanded, provides a potential support for realizing atomic network reconfiguration and performance improvement of carbon-based functional nanomaterials and nano-devices. ### \n###\n", "label": [[290, 1858, "abstract"]]}

Goldsmith symbols: '[1 *]'  --- ABSTRACT: The successful deployment of technologies for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (ENR) to ammonia would enable distributed ammonia production with lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to the Haber-Bosch process. However, electrocatalysts that can readily activate N2, promote selective ammonia formation over the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, and maintain stability under reaction conditions are needed to enable this technology. Herein, we give our perspective on the use of metal oxynitrides () for ENR, with emphasis on perovskite oxynitrides as an emerging materials class. We contrast the activity, selectivity, and stability of metal oxynitrides with their metal nitride and metal oxide counterparts. We discuss the different ENR reaction mechanisms on metal oxynitrides, emphasize challenges related to using metal oxynitrides for ENR, and provide an outlook for future research. Ultimately, the huge design space of metal oxynitrides is ripe for exploration to find catalyst formulations that overcome some of the limitations of traditional metal oxides and metal nitrides for ENR. ### \n###\n", "label": [[279, 1381, "abstract"]]}

This notwithstanding, studies on their structural stability are scarce. Here we report our findings on the high-pressure behavior of Co2V2O7. Cobalt pyrovanadate is found to be structurally stable up to at least 6 GPa, as single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction experiments confirm the absence of phase transitions in this pressure range. The stability of Co2V2O7 under compression is attributed to the 6-fold coordination of the Co2+ atom, as opposed, for instance, to the extreme instability observed in its Zn2V2O7 counterpart, where Zn2+ has an effective coordination number of less than 5. Regarding electronic and optical properties, Co2V2O7 is found to have an indirect band gap which closes under compression due to the shortening of the Co \u2013 O bonds. No collapses of the band gap have been observed up to 10 GPa. Ab initio simulations, up to above 10 GPa, support and extend our findings, which are discussed by comparison with analogue compounds. They also provide a description of vibrational and elastic properties, including Raman and IR modes and their symmetry assignment. ### \n###\n", "label": [[405, 1657, "abstract"]]}

Beck symbols: '[N/A]' - name: Shuchen Hsieh symbols: '[*]'  --- ABSTRACT: We doped the perovskite (PVSK) surface with tin or germanium to replace a portion of the lead. This substitution not only reduced the lead toxicity, but also stabilized the overall structure due to the size matching relationship between the substituted ions and the internal ions of the perovskite. A scanning Kelvin probe microscope (SKPM) was used to analyze the trend of surface potentials of perovskite thin films stored under different humidity conditions (RH 25-75%). Results showed that the overall change in surface potential due to increased humidity for Sn-doped and Ge-doped PVSK was lower than that of undoped PVSK. Additionally, force curves were acquired under controlled ambient humidity conditions to measure the adhesion forces between the probe and the pure PVSK and Sn-doped PVSK surfaces. An overall trend of increasing adhesion was observed going from low to high humidity for all surfaces. Between surfaces, in particular for the Sn-doped vs the pure PVSK sample at (RH 75%), the adhesion was much lower at 15.66 vs 19.21 nN, respectively. This indicates that the Sn-doped PVSK surface exhibits higher resistance to water adsorption. The force curve method is useful for investigating the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the perovskite surface. ### \n###\n", "label": [[257, 1533, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "Abstract: The huge consumption and rapid expansion of polymeric materials in the world have caused pervasive environmental pollution and severe waste of material resources, urging the development of sustainable substitutes that are repeatedly healable and recyclable. In the past two decades, significant progress has been made in the development of healable and recyclable polymers based on the reversible noncovalent and/or dynamic covalent cross-linking of polymer chains. This Perspective focuses on the achievements on the mechanically robust dynamically cross-linked polymers with healability and recyclability. The strategies for the reinforcement of healable/recyclable polymers are highlighted, considering that the dynamically cross-linked polymers generally exhibit low mechanical robustness. The robust dynamically cross-linked polymers that are healable/recyclable upon heating and at mild conditions are also summarized. The emerging applications of the robust healable and recyclable polymers are further demonstrated. Outlooks are also provided to envision the remaining challenges for the further development and practical applications of healable and recyclable polymer materials.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[10, 1198, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT In the fields of biology and medicine, comprehensive protein analysis at the single-cell level utilizing mass spectrometry (MS) with pL sample volumes and zmol to amol sensitivity is required. Our group has developed nanofluidic analytical pretreatment methods that exploit nanochannels for downsizing chemical unit operations to fL-pL volumes. In the field of analytical instruments, mass spectrometers have advanced to achieve ultrahigh sensitivity. However, a method to interface between fL-pL pretreatments and mass spectrometer without sample loss and dispersion is still challenging. In this study, we developed an MS interface utilizing nanofluidics to achieve high-sensitivity detection. After charging analyte molecules by an applied voltage through an electrode, liquid sample was converted to fL droplets by a nanofluidic device. Considering the inertial force that acts on the droplets, the droplets were carried with a controlled trajectory, even in turbulent air flow, and injected into a mass spectrometer with 100% efficiency. A module for heat transfer was designed and constructed, by which all of the injected droplets were vaporized to produce gas-phase ions. The detection of caffeine ions was achieved at a limit of detection of 1.52 amol, which was 290 times higher than a conventional MS interface by electrospray ionization with sample dispersion combined with a similar mass spectrometer. Therefore, sensitivity that was 2 orders of magnitude higher could be realized due to the 100% sample injection rate. The present study provides a new methodology for the analysis of ultrasmall samples with high-sensitivity, such as protein molecules produced from a single cell.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[9, 1703, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT:  Redox mediator (RM) have become a significant point in the now-established Li\u2013O2 battery system to reduce the charging overpotential in oxygen evolution process. Nevertheless, a major inherent barrier of the RM is that the redox shuttling between the Li metal anode and mobile RM, resulting in the corrosion of Li and depletion of RM. In this study, taking iodide/triiodide as a model RM, we propose an effective strategy by immersing the Li metal anode in I2 steam to create a 1.5 \uf06dm-thick surface protective layer. The resultant ionic conductive LiI layer on the Li metal anode can not only suppress Li dendrite growth but also act as a buffer layer between the RM and bare Li. By combining the iodide/triiodide RM with LiI protective layer, the Li-O2 battery shows low and steady charge voltage plateaus of ~3.6 V over 70 cycles. Importantly, the symmetrical cell using the LiI-protected Li electrode exhibits small Li-plating/stripping overpotentials (~20 mV, 480 h), far superior than that of the bare Li electrode (~70 mV, 300 h). The in situ interfacial observation shows that dendrite growth on the Li metal can be effectively suppressed by optimizing the LiI protective layer.    ### \n###\n", "label": [[11, 1196, "abstract"]]}

The zirconate coupling agent was used as for surface engineering of TiO2 nanoparticles to form stable organic phase nanodispersions. The surface modification of zirconate reduced the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles, which is beneficial for the resistance of nanocomposites to light ageing. The modified TiO2 nanoparticles can be uniformly dispersed in the siloxane substrate. The nanocomposites of TiO2 nanoparticles and silicone exhibited ultrahigh refractive index of 2.01, which put forward an innovative approach to prepare a high RI siloxane hybrid material for LED encapsulants and other optical devices. ### \n###\n", "label": [[11, 777, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT  Cyclodextrin (CD) has been widely used as a solubilizing agent for poorly water-soluble drugs. In the present study, the effect of CD on the amorphous drug solubility and the maximum thermodynamic activity of the drug in the aqueous phase when the drug concentration exceeded the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) concentration was investigated using three chemically diverse CDs, \u03b2-CD, dimethyl-\u03b2-CD (DM-\u03b2-CD), and hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-CD (HP-\u03b2-CD). The amorphous solubility of ibuprofen (IBP) increased substantially linearly with the increase in the CD concentration due to IBP/CD complex formation. Surprisingly, although the crystalline solubility of IBP in the \u03b2-CD solution reached a plateau at \u03b2-CD concentrations above 3 mM (BS-type solubility diagram) because of the limited crystalline solubility of the IBP/\u03b2-CD complex, the amorphous solubility of IBP increased linearly even when the \u03b2-CD concentration was higher than 3 mM. The amorphous solubility of IBP in CD solutions was influenced primarily by the phase separation of the IBP-supersaturated solution to the aqueous phase and the other phase mainly composed of IBP, namely the IBP-rich phase, via LLPS. NMR spectroscopy revealed that DM-\u03b2-CD was distributed into the IBP-rich phase when the IBP concentration exceeded its amorphous solubility, while \u03b2-CD and HP-\u03b2-CD showed minimal mixing with the IBP-rich phase. NMR diffusometry showed that the maximum free IBP concentration was reduced in the DM-\u03b2-CD solution compared to that in the buffer. The mixing of DM-\u03b2-CD with the IBP-rich phase reduced the chemical potential of IBP in the IBP-rich phase, which in turn reduced the maximum thermodynamic activity of IBP in the aqueous phase. In contrast, the maximum free IBP concentration was unchanged when \u03b2-CD or HP-\u03b2-CD was present. The hydrophobic nature of the DM-\u03b2-CD substituent may contribute to its partitioning into the IBP-rich phase. The present study highlights the impact of CD on the maximum thermodynamic activity of drugs, as well as the apparent amorphous solubility of the drug. This aspect should be considered for improving the effective absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs. Keywords.

{"text": "Abstract  Accumulating evidence linked extreme temperature events (ETEs) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) to cardiometabolic multi-morbidity (CMM); however, it remained unknown if and how ETEs and PM2.5 interact to trigger CMM occurrence. Merging four Chinese national cohorts with 64140 free-CMM adults, we provided strong evidence between ETEs, PM2.5 exposure and CMM occurrence. Performing Cox hazards regression models along with additive interaction analyses, we found that the hazards ratio (HRs) of CMM occurrence associated with heatwave and cold spell were 1.006-1.019 and 1.063-1.091, respectively. Each 10 \u03bcg/m3 increment of PM2.5 concentration was associated with 17.9% (95% confidence interval: 13.9-22.0%) increased risk of CMM. Similar adverse effects were also found among PM2.5 constituents of nitrate, organic matter, sulfate, ammonium, and black carbon. We observed a synergetic interaction of heatwave and PM2.5 pollution on CMM occurrence with relative excess risk due to interaction of 0.999 (0.663-1.334). Our study provides novel evidence that both ETEs and PM2.5 exposure were positively associated with CMM occurrence, and the heatwave interacts synergistically with PM2.5 to trigger CMM.

{"text": "Abstract  Cell membrane proteins are important components used to study cellular life processes and for clinical diagnostics. Currently, the signal of membrane protein imaging is limited to the pivot of the target, significantly limiting signal amplification efficiency and output, unlike the efficiency observed in solution systems. Inspired by the widespread recruitment phenomenon in natural life activities, here, we propose a molecular dynamic recruitment technique for the amplified imaging of cell membrane proteins. It overcomes the limitations of imaging based on the target protein as a pivot point, allowing the signal at the pivot point to diffuse across the entire cell membrane, significantly enhancing signal amplification capability. To achieve this goal, firstly, two types of DNA are labeled respectively to the cell membrane and membrane proteins. Then, the strand displacement of the effector DNA triggers molecular dynamic recruitment based on an entropy-driven circuit, recruiting a large number of probes from the solution to the cell membrane, thus realizing the amplified imaging of membrane proteins.In summary, we have constructed a novel platform for amplified imaging of membrane protein, 33 providing a new perspective for the application of cell diagnostics.

{"text": "Abstract The green nanotechnology-based approaches have been acquired as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective with many biomedical applications. The present study reported the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from the leaves of Emblica phyllantus and characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, EDX, SEM, AFM, and XRD. Acute and chronic antidiabetic and hypolipidemic potential of AgNPs was studied in alloxan induced diabetic mice. 11 groups (G1-G11, n=6) of mice were treated with different concentrations (150, 300 mM) and sizes of AgNPs and compared with standard glibenclaimide. A significant decrease (P >0.05) in glucose level was achieved for 30, 45 and 65 nm after 15 days of treatment compared to diabetic control. The oral administration of optimal AgNPs reduced the glucose level from 280.83 + 4.17 to 151.17 + 3.54 mg/dl while the standard drug glibinaclaimide showed the reduction in glucose from 265.5 + 1.43 to 192 + 3.4 mg/dl. Histopathological studies were performed in dissected kidney and liver tissues of the treated mice which revealed significant recovery in liver and kidney after AgNPs treatment. Acute toxicity study revealed that AgNPs were safe up to a size of 400nm and raw leaf extract of Emblica phyllantus up to 2500 mg/kg.b.w. This study may help to provide more effective and safe treatment options for diabetes compared to traditionally prescribed antidiabetic drugs. ### \n###\n", "label": [[9, 1415, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "Abstract  Targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) through allosteric sites offer advantages over orthosteric sites in identifying drugs with increased selectivity and potentially reduced side effects. In this study, we have developed a probe confined dynamic mapping protocol that allows the prediction of allosteric sites at both the GPCR extracellular and intracellular sides, as well as at the receptor-lipid interface. The applied harmonic wall potential enhanced sampling of probe molecules in a selected area of a GPCR while preventing membrane distortion in molecular dynamics simulations. The specific probes derived from GPCR allosteric ligand structures performed better in allosteric site mapping compared to commonly used cosolvents. The M2 muscarinic, \u03b22 adrenergic and P2Y1 purinergic receptors were selected for protocol\u2019s retrospective validation. The protocol was next validated prospectively to locate the binding site of [5-fluoro-4-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methoxyphenyl]-(4-fluoro-1H-indol-1-yl)methanone at the D2 dopamine receptor and subsequent mutagenesis confirmed the prediction. The protocol provides fast and efficient prediction of key amino acid residues surrounding allosteric sites in membrane proteins and facilitates structure-based design of allosteric modulators. ### \n###\n", "label": [[10, 1299, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "ABSTRACT: We have developed a reaction monitoring method which provides quantitative information throughout exchange, transmetalation, and cross-coupling for a Negishi reaction. Online HPLC and ReactIR were used as orthogonal techniques to corroborate time-course data throughout each step. Excellent agreement between the two techniques was observed throughout monitoring the magnesium/bromine exchange. Quantitative information regarding the transmetalation was gathered via a novel, inline quenching technique facilitated by online HPLC. Quenching reaction aliquots with the electrophile 4-chlorobenzaldehyde allowed us to determine the extent of transmetalation because of its selectivity for reacting with organomagnesiums. After transmetalation, the Negishi reaction was performed and monitored using online LC. Titrating ZnCl2 into a solution of the arylmagnesium allowed us to gain insights into zinc speciation in situ. Less than one equivalent of ZnCl2 was needed to achieve complete transmetalation evidencing the presence of diorganozincs/arylzincates. Additionally, using substoichiometric quantities of ZnCl2 resulted in higher rates of catalysis for the Negishi reaction.

{"text": "Abstract:  Resonant photonic sensors are enjoying much attention based on the worldwide drive towards personalised healthcare diagnostics and the need to better monitor the environment. Recent developments exploiting novel concepts such as metasurfaces, bound states in the continuum (BIC) and topological sensing have added to the interest in this topic. The drive towards increasingly higher Q-factors, combined with the requirement for low costs, make it critical to understand the impact of realistic limitations such as losses on photonic sensors. Traditionally, it is assumed that the reduction in Q-factor sufficiently accounts for the presence of loss. Here, we highlight that this assumption is overly simplistic and we show that losses have a stronger impact on the resonance amplitude than on the Q-factor. We note that the effect of the resonance amplitude has been largely ignored in the literature, and there is no physical model clearly describing the relationship between limit of detection, Q-factor and resonance amplitude. We have therefore developed a novel, ab-initio analytical model, where we derive the complete figure of merit for resonant photonic sensors and determine their limit of detection. In addition to highlighting the importance of the optical losses and the resonance amplitude, we show that, counter-intuitively, optimisation of the limit of detection is not achieved by maximisation of the Q-factor, but by counterbalancing Q-factor and amplitude. We validate the model experimentally, put it into context and show that it is essential for applying novel sensing concepts in realistic scenarios.  ### \n###\n", "label": [[11, 1634, "abstract"]]}

{"text": "Abstract: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a discriminative blood biomarker for many neurological diseases, such as traumatic brain injury. Detection of GFAP in buffer solution using biosensors has been demonstrated but its accurate quantification in patient samples has not been reported, yet in urgent need. Herein, we demonstrate a robust on-chip graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) biosensing method for sensitive and ultrafast detection of GFAP in patient plasma. Patients with moderate-severe traumatic brain injuries, defined by the Mayo classification, are recruited to provide plasma samples. The binding of target GFAP with the specific antibodies that are conjugated on a monolayer GFET device triggers the shift of its Dirac point; and this signal change is correlated with the GFAP concentration in the patient plasma. The limit-of-detections (LOD) of 20 fg/mL (400 aM) in buffer solution and 231 fg/mL (4 fM) in patient plasma, have been achieved using this approach. In parallel, for the first time, we compare our results to the state-of-the-art Single molecule array (Simoa) technology and the classic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for reference. The GFET biosensor shows competitive LOD to Simoa (1.18 pg/mL), and it is also faster in sample-to-result time (< 15mins), cheaper, and more user-friendly. In comparison to ELISA, GFET offers advantages of total detection time, detection sensitivity, and simplicity. This GFET biosensing platform holds high promise for the point-of-care diagnosis and monitoring of traumatic brain injury in GP surgeries and patient homes. ### \n###\n", "label": [[10, 1612, "abstract"]]}
