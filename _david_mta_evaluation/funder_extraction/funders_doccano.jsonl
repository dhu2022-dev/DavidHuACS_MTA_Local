Theranostics: A single probe that can concurrently or sequentially perform at least one diagnostic and one therapeutic function.   Radiation therapy: A clinically practiced therapeutic paradigm that involves ablation of tumor cells with ionizing radiation emanating from non-radioactive nanoparticles with high atomic numbers exposed to x-ray radiation.Ion-beam therapy: An emerging therapeutic paradigm that involves ablation of tumor cells with ionizing radiation emanating from certain non-radioactive nanoparticles exposed to ion-beams.Neutron capture Therapy: A therapeutic paradigm that involves ablation of tumor cells with ionizing radiation emanating from 10B or 157Gd containing non-radioactive probes exposed to neutron beams.Laser ablation nanoparticle synthesis: A top-down method of synthesizing monodispersed and ultrapure nanoparticles involving exposure of corresponding bulk materials with high-energy laser beams.<\/p><\/div>\n###\n","label":[[346,372,"Funder"],[374,393,"Grant"],[493,555,"Funder"],[568,584,"Grant"],[726,775,"Funder"],[822,842,"Grant"],[881,910,"Funder"],[918,929,"Grant"],[931,939,"Grant"],[944,955,"Grant"]],"Comments":[]}
