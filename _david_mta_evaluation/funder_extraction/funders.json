His research is focused on design and preparation of metal-organic frameworks for gas/liquid separation, sensing, and other applications.Gérard Delahay has obtained his PhD at University of Lille in 1984. In 1988, after several postdoctoral positions, he joined, as CNRS researcher, the Laboratory for Coordination Chemistry in Toulouse where he focussed on oxibronzes for catalytic applications. Then he moved to Montpellier where he started to develop catalysis for air pollution control. Since 2008, he has been CNRS research director at the Charles Gerhardt Institute in Montpellier.Dr Youssef Belmabkhout is a Full Professor at Mohammed VI polytechnic University. He has a PhD in Applied Sciences from the University of Mons (Belgium) and hold also a Chemical Engineering degree from the Gubkine Russian State University in Moscow (Russia). His doctoral expertise covers various aspects of reactive and non-reactive adsorption. He has been recognized among most cited researchers in the world by Web of Sciences in 2019 and 2020 and 2021.Amandine Cadiau holds a PhD in solid-state chemistry from Le Mans University (2010). After several post-doctoral positions (in Prof. Rocha, Serre, Eddaoudi, Gascon groups), she joined the Charles Gerhardt Institute in Montpellier (2018). Her work is mainly focused on the synthesis and crystallographic characterisation of MOF materials.</p></div>\n###\n",
